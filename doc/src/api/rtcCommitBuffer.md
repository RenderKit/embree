% rtcCommitSBuffer(3) | Embree Ray Tracing Kernels 4

#### NAME

    rtcCommitBuffer - commits buffer content from host to device

#### SYNOPSIS

    #include <embree4/rtcore.h>

    void rtcCommitBuffer(RTCBuffer buffer);

#### DESCRIPTION

If the buffer was created using `rtcNewBufferHostDevice` the 
`rtcCommitBuffer` function commits changes of the host buffer data 
to the device. If the buffer was created with a non SYCL Embree device 
or the SYCL device has host unified memory, this call has no effect.

The call to `rtcCommitBuffer` will internally use a temporary SYCL 
queue and wait for the memory copy to finish. The function 
`rtcCommitBufferWithQueue` can be used to asyncronously copy the 
data to the device.
#### EXIT STATUS

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.
