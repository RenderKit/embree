#### NAME

    rtcInitPointQueryContext - initializes the context information (e.g.
      stack of (multilevel-)instance transformations) for point queries

#### SYNOPSIS

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    struct RTC_ALIGN(16) RTCPointQueryContext
    {
      // accumulated 4x4 column major matrices from world to instance space.
      float world2inst[RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT][16];
      
      // accumulated 4x4 column major matrices from instance to world space.
      float inst2world[RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT][16];

      // instance ids.
      unsigned int instID[RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT];
      
      // number of instances currently on the stack.
      unsigned int instStackSize;
    };

    void rtcInitPointQueryContext(
      struct RTCPointQueryContext* context
    );

#### DESCRIPTION

A stack (`RTCPointQueryContext` type) which stores the IDs and instance
transformations during a BVH traversal for a point query. The transformations
are assumed to be affine transformations (3Ã—3 matrix plus translation) and
therefore the last column is ignored (see [RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE] for
details).

The `rtcInitPointContext` function initializes the context to
default values and should be called for initialization.

The context will be passed as an argument to the point query callback function
(see [rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction]) and should be used to pass instance
information down the instancing chain for user defined instancing (see
tutorial [ClosestPoint] for a reference implementation of point queries with
user defined instancing).

The context is an necessary argument to [rtcPointQuery] and Embree internally
uses the topmost instance transformation of the stack to transform the point
query into instance space.

#### EXIT STATUS

No error code is set by this function.
