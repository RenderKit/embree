Optimization Notice: Intel's compilers may or may not optimize to the
same degree for non-Intel microprocessors for optimizations that are not
unique to Intel microprocessors. These optimizations include SSE2, SSE3,
and SSSE3 instruction sets and other optimizations. Intel does not
guarantee the availability, functionality, or effectiveness of any
optimization on microprocessors not manufactured by Intel.
Microprocessor-dependent optimizations in this product are intended for
use with Intel microprocessors. Certain optimizations not specific to
Intel microarchitecture are reserved for Intel microprocessors. Please
refer to the applicable product User and Reference Guides for more
information regarding the specific instruction sets covered by this
notice.

Software and workloads used in performance tests may have been optimized
for performance only on Intel microprocessors.  
Performance tests, such as SYSmark and MobileMark, are measured using
specific computer systems, components, software, operations and
functions. Any change to any of those factors may cause the results to
vary. You should consult other information and performance tests to
assist you in fully evaluating your contemplated purchases, including
the performance of that product when combined with other products.
