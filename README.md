% Intel Corporation

Embree Overview
===============

Intel® Embree is a collection of high-performance ray tracing kernels,
developed at Intel. The target users of Intel® Embree are graphics application
engineers who want to improve the performance of their
photo-realistic rendering application by leveraging Embree's
performance-optimized ray tracing kernels. The kernels are optimized
for the latest Intel® processors with support for SSE, AVX, AVX2, and
AVX-512 instructions. Intel® Embree supports runtime code selection to choose
the traversal and build algorithms that best matches the instruction
set of your CPU. We recommend using Intel® Embree through its API to get the
highest benefit from future improvements. Intel® Embree is released as Open
Source under the
[Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

Intel® Embree supports applications written with the Intel® Implicit SPMD
Program Compiler (Intel® ISPC, <https://ispc.github.io/>) by also providing an Intel® ISPC
interface to the core ray tracing algorithms. This makes it possible
to write a renderer in Intel® ISPC that automatically vectorizes and
leverages SSE, AVX, AVX2, and AVX-512 instructions. Intel® ISPC also supports
runtime code selection, thus Intel® ISPC will select the best code path for
your application.

Intel® Embree contains algorithms optimized for incoherent workloads (e.g.
Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithms) and coherent workloads
(e.g. primary visibility and hard shadow rays).

The single-ray traversal kernels of Intel® Embree provide high performance
for incoherent workloads and are very easy to integrate into existing
rendering applications. Using the stream kernels, even higher
performance for incoherent rays is possible, but integration might
require significant code changes to the application to use the stream
paradigm. In general for coherent workloads, the stream mode with
coherent flag set gives the best performance.

Intel® Embree also supports dynamic scenes by implementing high-performance
two-level spatial index structure construction algorithms.

In addition to the ray tracing kernels, Intel® Embree provides some
[Embree Tutorials] to demonstrate how to use the
[Embree API].

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Embree supports Windows (32-bit and 64-bit), Linux (64-bit), and macOS
(64-bit) both x86 and Apple M1 based. The code compiles with the Intel®
Compiler, GCC, Clang, and the Microsoft Compiler.

Using the Intel® Compiler improves performance by approximately
10%. Performance also varies across different operating
systems, with Linux typically performing best as it supports
transparently transitioning to 2MB pages.

Embree is optimized for Intel CPUs supporting SSE, AVX, AVX2, and
AVX-512 instructions. Embree requires at least an x86 CPU with support for
SSE2 or an Apple M1 CPU.

Installation of Embree
======================

Windows ZIP File
-----------------

Embree linked against Visual Studio 2015 are provided as a ZIP file
[embree-3.13.4.x64.vc14.windows.zip](https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/download/v3.13.4/embree-3.13.4.x64.vc14.windows.zip). After
unpacking this ZIP file, you should set the path to the `lib` folder
manually to your `PATH` environment variable for applications to find
Embree.

Linux tar.gz Files
------------------

The Linux version of Embree is also delivered as a `tar.gz` file:
[embree-3.13.4.x86_64.linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/download/v3.13.4/embree-3.13.4.x86_64.linux.tar.gz). Unpack
this file using `tar` and source the provided `embree-vars.sh` (if you
are using the bash shell) or `embree-vars.csh` (if you are using the C
shell) to set up the environment properly:

    tar xzf embree-3.13.4.x86_64.linux.tar.gz
    source embree-3.13.4.x86_64.linux/embree-vars.sh

We recommend adding a relative `RPATH` to your application that points
to the location where Embree (and TBB) can be found, e.g. `$ORIGIN/../lib`.

macOS ZIP file
-----------------

The macOS version of Embree is also delivered as a ZIP file:
[embree-3.13.4.x86_64.macosx.zip](https://github.com/embree/embree/releases/download/v3.13.4/embree-3.13.4.x86_64.macosx.zip). Unpack
this file using `tar` and source the provided `embree-vars.sh` (if you
are using the bash shell) or `embree-vars.csh` (if you are using the C
shell) to set up the environment properly:

    unzip embree-3.13.4.x64.macosx.zip
    source embree-3.13.4.x64.macosx/embree-vars.sh

If you want to ship Embree with your application, please use the Embree
library of the provided ZIP file. The library name of that Embree
library is of the form `@rpath/libembree.3.dylib`
(and similar also for the included TBB library). This ensures that you
can add a relative `RPATH` to your application that points to the location
where Embree (and TBB) can be found, e.g. `@loader_path/../lib`.

Compiling Embree
================

We recommend to use CMake to build Embree. Do not enable fast-math
optimizations; these might break Embree.

Linux and macOS
---------------

To compile Embree you need a modern C++ compiler that supports
C++11. Embree is tested with the following compilers:

Linux

  - Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2022.0.0
  - Intel® Compiler 2020 Update 1
  - Intel® Compiler 2019 Update 4
  - Intel® Compiler 2017 Update 1
  - Intel® Compiler 2016 Update 3
  - Intel® Compiler 2015 Update 3
  - Clang 5.0.0
  - Clang 4.0.0
  - GCC 10.0.1 (Fedora 32) AVX512 support
  - GCC  8.3.1 (Fedora 28) AVX512 support
  - GCC  7.3.1 (Fedora 27) AVX2 support
  - GCC  7.3.1 (Fedora 26) AVX2 support
  - GCC  6.4.1 (Fedora 25) AVX2 support

macOS x86

  - Intel® Compiler 2020 Update 1
  - Intel® Compiler 2019 Update 4
  - Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (macOS 10.14.6)

macOS M1

  - Apple Clang 12.0.0

Embree supports using the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB) as the
tasking system. For performance and flexibility reasons we recommend
to use Embree with the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and best
also use TBB inside your application. Optionally you can disable TBB
in Embree through the `EMBREE_TASKING_SYSTEM` CMake variable.

Embree supports the Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel® ISPC), which allows
straightforward parallelization of an entire renderer. If you do not
want to use Intel® ISPC then you can disable `EMBREE_ISPC_SUPPORT` in
CMake. Otherwise, download and install the Intel® ISPC binaries (we have
tested Intel® ISPC version 1.9.1) from
[ispc.github.io](https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html). After
installation, put the path to `ispc` permanently into your `PATH`
environment variable or you need to correctly set the
`EMBREE_ISPC_EXECUTABLE` variable during CMake configuration.

You additionally have to install CMake 3.1.0 or higher and the developer
version of GLUT.

Under macOS, all these dependencies can be installed
using [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org/):

    sudo port install cmake tbb-devel glfw-devel

Depending on your Linux distribution you can install these dependencies
using `yum` or `apt-get`.  Some of these packages might already be
installed or might have slightly different names.

Type the following to install the dependencies using `yum`:

    sudo yum install cmake
    sudo yum install tbb-devel
    sudo yum install glfw-devel

Type the following to install the dependencies using `apt-get`:

    sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui
    sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
    sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev

Finally you can compile Embree using CMake. Create a build directory
inside the Embree root directory and execute `ccmake ..` inside this
build directory.

    mkdir build
    cd build
    ccmake ..

Per default CMake will use the compilers specified with the `CC` and
`CXX` environment variables. Should you want to use a different
compiler, run `cmake` first and set the `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` and
`CMAKE_C_COMPILER` variables to the desired compiler. For example, to
use the Intel® Compiler instead of the default GCC on most Linux machines
(`g++` and `gcc`), execute

    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icc ..

Similarly, to use Clang set the variables to `clang++` and `clang`,
respectively. Note that the compiler variables cannot be changed anymore
after the first run of `cmake` or `ccmake`.

Running `ccmake` will open a dialog where you can perform various
configurations as described below in [CMake Configuration]. After having
configured Embree, press `c` (for configure) and `g` (for generate) to
generate a Makefile and leave the configuration. The code can be
compiled by executing make.

    make

The executables will be generated inside the build folder. We recommend
to finally install the Embree library and header files on your
system. Therefore set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/usr` in cmake
and type:

    sudo make install

If you keep the default `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` of `/usr/local` then
you have to make sure the path `/usr/local/lib` is in your
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

You can also uninstall Embree again by executing:

    sudo make uninstall

If you cannot install Embree on your system (e.g. when you don't have
administrator rights) you need to add embree_root_directory/build to
your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.


Windows
-------

Embree is tested using the following compilers under Windows:

  - Visual Studio 2019
  - Visual Studio 2017
  - Visual Studio 2015 (Update 1)
  - Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler 2022.0.0
  - Intel® Compiler 2019 Update 6
  - Intel® Compiler 2017 Update 8
  - LLVM Clang 9.0.0

To compile Embree for AVX-512 you have to use the Intel® Compiler.

Embree supports using the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB) as the
tasking system. For performance and flexibility reasons we recommend
to use Embree with the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB) and best
also use TBB inside your application. Optionally you can disable TBB
in Embree through the `EMBREE_TASKING_SYSTEM` CMake variable.

Embree will either find the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
installation that comes with the Intel® Compiler, or you can install the
binary distribution of TBB directly from
[https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/releases](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB/releases)
into a folder named `tbb` into your Embree root directory. You also have
to make sure that the libraries `tbb.dll` and `tbb_malloc.dll` can be
found when executing your Embree applications, e.g. by putting the path
to these libraries into your `PATH` environment variable.

Embree supports the Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel® ISPC), which allows
straightforward parallelization of an entire renderer. When installing
Intel® ISPC, make sure to download an Intel® ISPC version from
[ispc.github.io](https://ispc.github.io/downloads.html) that is
compatible with your Visual Studio version. After installation, put
the path to `ispc.exe` permanently into your `PATH` environment
variable or you need to correctly set the `EMBREE_ISPC_EXECUTABLE` variable
during CMake configuration. If you do not want to use Intel® ISPC then you
can disable `EMBREE_ISPC_SUPPORT` in CMake.

We have tested Embree with the following Intel® ISPC versions:

  - Intel® ISPC 1.14.1
  - Intel® ISPC 1.13.0
  - Intel® ISPC 1.12.0
  - Intel® ISPC 1.9.2

You additionally have to install [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/)
(version 2.8.11 or higher). Note that you need a native Windows CMake
installation, because CMake under Cygwin cannot generate solution files
for Visual Studio.

### Using the IDE

Run `cmake-gui`, browse to the Embree sources, set the build directory
and click Configure. Now you can select the Generator, e.g. "Visual
Studio 12 2013" for a 32-bit build or "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64"
for a 64-bit build.

To use a different compiler than the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, you
additionally need to specify the proper compiler toolset through the
option "Optional toolset to use (-T parameter)". E.g. to use Clang for
compilation set the toolset to "LLVM_v142", to use the Intel®
Compiler 2017 for compilation set the toolset to "Intel C++
Compiler 17.0".

Do not change the toolset manually in a solution file (neither through
the project properties dialog, nor through the "Use Intel Compiler"
project context menu), because then some compiler specific command line
options cannot be set by CMake.

Most configuration parameters described in the [CMake Configuration]
can be set under Windows as well. Finally, click "Generate" to create
the Visual Studio solution files. 

The following CMake options are only available under Windows:

+ `CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPE`:  List of generated
  configurations. Default value is Debug;Release;RelWithDebInfo.

+  `USE_STATIC_RUNTIME`: Use the static version of the C/C++ runtime
  library. This option is turned OFF by default.

Use the generated Visual Studio solution file `embree2.sln` to compile
the project. To build Embree with support for the AVX2 instruction set
you need at least Visual Studio 2013 (Update 4).

We recommend enabling syntax highlighting for the `.ispc` source and
`.isph` header files. To do so open Visual Studio, go to Tools ⇒
Options ⇒ Text Editor ⇒ File Extension and add the `isph` and `ispc`
extensions for the "Microsoft Visual C++" editor.

### Using the Command Line

Embree can also be configured and built without the IDE using the Visual
Studio command prompt:

    cd path\to\embree
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" ..
    cmake --build . --config Release

To use the Intel® Compiler, set the proper toolset, e.g. for Intel
Compiler 17.0:

    cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64" -T "Intel C++ Compiler 17.0" ..
    cmake --build . --config Release

You can also build only some projects with the `--target` switch.
Additional parameters after "`--`" will be passed to `msbuild`. For
example, to build the Embree library in parallel use

    cmake --build . --config Release --target embree -- /m


CMake Configuration
-------------------

The default CMake configuration in the configuration dialog should be
appropriate for most usages. The following list describes all
parameters that can be configured in CMake:

+ `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`: Can be used to switch between Debug mode
  (Debug), Release mode (Release) (default), and Release mode with
  enabled assertions and debug symbols (RelWithDebInfo).

+ `EMBREE_STACK_PROTECTOR`: Enables protection of return address
  from buffer overwrites. This option is OFF by default.

+ `EMBREE_ISPC_SUPPORT`: Enables Intel® ISPC support of Embree. This option
  is ON by default.

+ `EMBREE_STATIC_LIB`: Builds Embree as a static library (OFF by
  default). Further multiple static libraries are generated for the
  different ISAs selected (e.g. `embree3.a`, `embree3_sse42.a`,
  `embree3_avx.a`, `embree3_avx2.a`, `embree3_avx512.a`). You have
  to link these libraries in exactly this order of increasing ISA.

+ `EMBREE_API_NAMESPACE`: Specifies a namespace name to put all Embree
  API symbols inside. By default no namespace is used and plain C symbols
  exported.

+ `EMBREE_LIBRARY_NAME`: Specifies the name of the Embree library file
  created. By default the name embree3 is used.

+ `EMBREE_IGNORE_CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`: When enabled, Embree ignores
  default CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS. This option is turned ON by default.

+ `EMBREE_TUTORIALS`: Enables build of Embree tutorials (default ON).

+ `EMBREE_BACKFACE_CULLING`: Enables backface culling, i.e. only
  surfaces facing a ray can be hit. This option is turned OFF by
  default.

+ `EMBREE_COMPACT_POLYS`: Enables compact tris/quads, i.e. only
  geomIDs and primIDs are stored inside the leaf nodes.  

+ `EMBREE_FILTER_FUNCTION`: Enables the intersection filter function
  feature (ON by default).

+ `EMBREE_RAY_MASK`: Enables the ray masking feature (OFF by default).

+ `EMBREE_RAY_PACKETS`: Enables ray packet traversal kernels. This
  feature is turned ON by default. When turned on packet traversal is
  used internally and packets passed to rtcIntersect4/8/16 are kept
  intact in callbacks (when the ISA of appropriate width is enabled).

+ `EMBREE_IGNORE_INVALID_RAYS`: Makes code robust against the risk of
  full-tree traversals caused by invalid rays (e.g. rays containing
  INF/NaN as origins). This option is turned OFF by default.

+ `EMBREE_TASKING_SYSTEM`: Chooses between Intel® Threading TBB
  Building Blocks (TBB), Parallel Patterns Library (PPL) (Windows
  only), or an internal tasking system (INTERNAL). By default TBB is
  used.

+ `EMBREE_TBB_ROOT`: If Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
  is used as a tasking system, search the library in this directory
  tree.

+ `EMBREE_TBB_COMPONENT`: The component/library name of Intel® Threading 
  Building Blocks (TBB). Embree searches for this library name (default: tbb)
  when TBB is used as tasking system.

+ `EMBREE_TBB_POSTFIX`: If Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
  is used as a tasking system, link to tbb<EMBREE_TBB_POSTFIX>.(so,dll,lib).
  Defaults to the empty string.

+ `EMBREE_TBB_DEBUG_ROOT`: If Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
  is used as a tasking system, search the library in this directory
  tree in Debug mode. Defaults to `EMBREE_TBB_ROOT`.

+ `EMBREE_TBB_DEBUG_POSTFIX`: If Intel® Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
  is used as a tasking system, link to tbb<EMBREE_TBB_DEBUG_POSTFIX>.(so,dll,lib)
  in Debug mode. Defaults to "_debug".

+ `EMBREE_MAX_ISA`: Select highest supported ISA (SSE2, SSE4.2, AVX,
  AVX2, AVX512, or NONE). When set to NONE the
  EMBREE_ISA_* variables can be used to enable ISAs individually. By
  default the option is set to AVX2.

+ `EMBREE_ISA_SSE2`: Enables SSE2 when EMBREE_MAX_ISA is set to
  NONE. By default this option is turned OFF.

+ `EMBREE_ISA_SSE42`: Enables SSE4.2 when EMBREE_MAX_ISA is set to
  NONE. By default this option is turned OFF.

+ `EMBREE_ISA_AVX`: Enables AVX when EMBREE_MAX_ISA is set to NONE. By
  default this option is turned OFF.

+ `EMBREE_ISA_AVX2`: Enables AVX2 when EMBREE_MAX_ISA is set to
  NONE. By default this option is turned OFF.

+ `EMBREE_ISA_AVX512`: Enables AVX-512 for Skylake when
  EMBREE_MAX_ISA is set to NONE. By default this option is turned OFF.

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_TRIANGLE`: Enables support for trianglegeometries
  (ON by default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_QUAD`: Enables support for quad geometries (ON by
  default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_CURVE`: Enables support for curve geometries (ON by
  default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_SUBDIVISION`: Enables support for subdivision
  geometries (ON by default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_INSTANCE`: Enables support for instances (ON by
  default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_USER`: Enables support for user defined geometries
  (ON by default).

+ `EMBREE_GEOMETRY_POINT`: Enables support for point geometries
  (ON by default).

+ `EMBREE_CURVE_SELF_INTERSECTION_AVOIDANCE_FACTOR`: Specifies a
  factor that controls the self intersection avoidance feature for flat
  curves. Flat curve intersections which are closer than
  curve_radius*`EMBREE_CURVE_SELF_INTERSECTION_AVOIDANCE_FACTOR` to
  the ray origin are ignored. A value of 0.0f disables self
  intersection avoidance while 2.0f is the default value.

+ `EMBREE_MIN_WIDTH`: Enabled the min-width feature, which allows
  increasing the radius of curves and points to match some amount of
  pixels. See [rtcSetGeometryMaxRadiusScale] for more details.

+ `EMBREE_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT`: Specifies the maximum number of nested
  instance levels. Should be greater than 0; the default value is 1.
  Instances nested any deeper than this value will silently disappear in
  release mode, and cause assertions in debug mode.


Using Embree
=============

The most convenient way of using Embree is through CMake. Just let
CMake find Embree using the `FIND_PACKAGE` function inside your
`CMakeLists.txt` file:

     FIND_PACKAGE(embree 3.0 REQUIRED)

To cmake to properly find Embree you need to set the `embree_DIR`
variable to the folder you extracted Embree to.

The `FIND_PACKAGE` function will create an embree target that
you can add to your target link libraries:

    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(application embree)

Now please have a look at the [Embree Tutorials] source code and the
[Embree API] section to get started.



Embree API
==========

The Embree API is a low-level C99 ray tracing API which can be used to
construct 3D scenes and perform ray queries of different types inside
these scenes. All API calls carry the prefix `rtc` (or `RTC` for types)
which stands for **r**ay **t**racing **c**ore.

The API also exists in an Intel® Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (Intel®
ISPC) version, which is almost identical but contains additional
functions that operate on ray packets with a size of the native SIMD
width used by Intel® ISPC. For simplicity this document refers to the
C99 version of the API functions. For changes when upgrading from the
Embree 2 to the current Embree 3 API see Section [Upgrading from
Embree 2 to Embree 3].

The API supports scenes consisting of different geometry types such as
triangle meshes, quad meshes (triangle pairs), grid meshes, flat
curves, round curves, oriented curves, subdivision meshes, instances,
and user-defined geometries. See Section [Scene Object](#scene-object)
for more information.

Finding the closest hit of a ray segment with the scene
(`rtcIntersect`-type functions), and determining whether any hit
between a ray segment and the scene exists (`rtcOccluded`-type
functions) are both supported. The API supports queries for single
rays, ray packets, and ray streams. See Section [Ray
Queries](#ray-queries) for more information.

The API is designed in an object-oriented manner, e.g. it contains
device objects (`RTCDevice` type), scene objects (`RTCScene` type),
geometry objects (`RTCGeometry` type), buffer objects (`RTCBuffer`
type), and BVH objects (`RTCBVH` type). All objects are reference
counted, and handles can be released by calling the appropriate release
function (e.g. `rtcReleaseDevice`) or retained by incrementing the
reference count (e.g. `rtcRetainDevice`). In general, API calls that
access the same object are not thread-safe, unless specified
differently. However, attaching geometries to the same scene and
performing ray queries in a scene is thread-safe.

Device Object
-------------

Embree supports a device concept, which allows different components of
the application to use the Embree API without interfering with each
other. An application typically first creates a device using the
[rtcNewDevice] function. This device can then be used to construct
further objects, such as scenes and geometries. Before the application
exits, it should release all devices by invoking [rtcReleaseDevice].
An application typically creates only a single device. If required
differently, it should only use a small number of devices at any given
time.

Each user thread has its own error flag per device. If an error occurs
when invoking an API function, this flag is set to an error code (if it
isn't already set by a previous error). See Section
[rtcGetDeviceError] for information on how to read the error code and
Section [rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction] on how to register a callback
that is invoked for each error encountered. It is recommended to always
set a error callback function, to detect all errors.

Scene Object
------------

A scene is a container for a set of geometries, and contains a spatial
acceleration structure which can be used to perform different types of
ray queries.

A scene is created using the `rtcNewScene` function call, and released
using the `rtcReleaseScene` function call. To populate a scene with
geometries use the `rtcAttachGeometry` call, and to detach them use the
`rtcDetachGeometry` call. Once all scene geometries are attached, an
`rtcCommitScene` call (or `rtcJoinCommitScene` call) will finish the
scene description and trigger building of internal data structures.
After the scene got committed, it is safe to perform ray queries (see
Section [Ray Queries](#ray-queries)) or to query the scene bounding box
(see [rtcGetSceneBounds] and [rtcGetSceneLinearBounds]).

If scene geometries get modified or attached or detached, the
`rtcCommitScene` call must be invoked before performing any further ray
queries for the scene; otherwise the effect of the ray query is
undefined. The modification of a geometry, committing the scene, and
tracing of rays must always happen sequentially, and never at the same
time. Any API call that sets a property of the scene or geometries
contained in the scene count as scene modification, e.g. including
setting of intersection filter functions.

Scene flags can be used to configure a scene to use less memory
(`RTC_SCENE_FLAG_COMPACT`), use more robust traversal algorithms
(`RTC_SCENE_FLAG_ROBUST`), and to optimize for dynamic content. See
Section [rtcSetSceneFlags] for more details.

A build quality can be specified for a scene to balance between
acceleration structure build performance and ray query performance. See
Section [rtcSetSceneBuildQuality] for more details on build quality.

Geometry Object
---------------

A new geometry is created using the `rtcNewGeometry` function.
Depending on the geometry type, different buffers must be bound (e.g.
using `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer`) to set up the geometry data. In
most cases, binding of a vertex and index buffer is required. The
number of primitives and vertices of that geometry is typically
inferred from the size of these bound buffers.

Changes to the geometry always must be committed using the
`rtcCommitGeometry` call before using the geometry. After committing, a
geometry is not included in any scene. A geometry can be added to a
scene by using the `rtcAttachGeometry` function (to automatically
assign a geometry ID) or using the `rtcAttachGeometryById` function (to
specify the geometry ID manually). A geometry can get attached to
multiple scenes.

All geometry types support multi-segment motion blur with an arbitrary
number of equidistant time steps (in the range of 2 to 129) inside a
user specified time range. Each geometry can have a different number of
time steps and a different time range. The motion blur geometry is
defined by linearly interpolating the geometries of neighboring time
steps. To construct a motion blur geometry, first the number of time
steps of the geometry must be specified using the
`rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` function, and then a vertex buffer for
each time step must be bound, e.g. using the
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` function. Optionally, a time range
defining the start (and end time) of the first (and last) time step can
be set using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeRange` function. This feature will
also allow geometries to appear and disappear during the camera shutter
time if the time range is a sub range of [0,1].

The API supports per-geometry filter callback functions (see
`rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction` and
`rtcSetGeometryOccludedFilterFunction`) that are invoked for each
intersection found during the `rtcIntersect`-type or `rtcOccluded`-type
calls. The former ones are called geometry intersection filter
functions, the latter ones geometry occlusion filter functions. These
filter functions are designed to be used to ignore intersections
outside of a user-defined silhouette of a primitive, e.g. to model tree
leaves using transparency textures.

Ray Queries
-----------

The API supports finding the closest hit of a ray segment with the
scene (`rtcIntersect`-type functions), and determining whether any hit
between a ray segment and the scene exists (`rtcOccluded`-type
functions).

Supported are single ray queries (`rtcIntersect1` and `rtcOccluded1`)
as well as ray packet queries for ray packets of size 4
(`rtcIntersect4` and `rtcOccluded4`), ray packets of size 8
(`rtcIntersect8` and `rtcOccluded8`), and ray packets of size 16
(`rtcIntersect16` and `rtcOccluded16`).

Ray streams in a variety of layouts are supported as well, such as
streams of single rays (`rtcIntersect1M` and `rtcOccluded1M`), streams
of pointers to single rays (`rtcIntersect1p` and `rtcOccluded1p`),
streams of ray packets (`rtcIntersectNM` and `rtcOccludedNM`), and
large packet-like streams in structure of pointer layout
(`rtcIntersectNp` and `rtcOccludedNp`).

See Sections [rtcIntersect1] and [rtcOccluded1] for a detailed
description of how to set up and trace a ray.

See tutorial [Triangle Geometry] for a complete example of how to
trace single rays and ray packets. Also have a look at the tutorial
[Stream Viewer] for an example of how to trace ray streams.

Point Queries
-------------

The API supports traversal of the BVH using a point query object that
specifies a location and a query radius. For all primitives
intersecting the according domain, a user defined callback function is
called which allows queries such as finding the closest point on the
surface geometries of the scene (see Tutorial [Closest Point]) or
nearest neighbour queries (see Tutorial [Voronoi]).

See Section [rtcPointQuery] for a detailed description of how to set
up point queries.

Collision Detection
-------------------

The Embree API also supports collision detection queries between two
scenes consisting only of user geometries. Embree only performs
broadphase collision detection, the narrow phase detection can be
performed through a callback function.

See Section [rtcCollide] for a detailed description of how to set up
collision detection.

Seen tutorial [Collision Detection](#collision-detection) for a
complete example of collision detection being used on a simple cloth
solver.

Miscellaneous
-------------

A context filter function, which can be set per ray query is supported
(see `rtcInitIntersectContext`). This filter function is designed to
change the semantics of the ray query, e.g. to accumulate opacity for
transparent shadows, count the number of surfaces along a ray, collect
all hits along a ray, etc.

The internal algorithms to build a BVH are exposed through the `RTCBVH`
object and `rtcBuildBVH` call. This call makes it possible to build a
BVH in a user-specified format over user-specified primitives. See the
documentation of the `rtcBuildBVH` call for more details.

For getting the most performance out of Embree, see the Section
[Performance Recommendations].

Upgrading from Embree 2 to Embree 3
===================================

We decided to introduce an improved API in Embree 3 that is not
backward compatible with the Embree 2 API. This step was required to
remove various deprecated API functions that accumulated over time,
improve extensibility of the API, fix suboptimal design decisions, fix
design mistakes (such as incompatible single ray and ray packet
layouts), clean up inconsistent naming, and increase flexibility.

To make porting to the new API easy, we provide a conversion script
that can do most of the work, and will annotate the code with remaining
changes required. The script can be invoked the following way for CPP
files:

    ./scripts/cpp-patch.py --patch embree2_to_embree3.patch
      --in infile.cpp --out outfile.cpp

When invoked for Intel® ISPC files, add the `--ispc` option:

    ./scripts/cpp-patch.py --ispc --patch embree2_to_embree3.patch
      --in infile.ispc --out outfile.ispc

Apply the script to each source file of your project that contains
Embree API calls or types. The input file and output file can also be
identical to perform the patch in-place. Please always backup your
original code before running the script, and inspect the code changes
done by the script using diff (e.g. `git diff`), to make sure no
undesired code locations got changed. Grep the code for comments
containing `EMBREE_FIXME` and perform the action described in the
comment.

The following changes need to be performed when switching from Embree 2
to Embree 3. Most of these changes are automatically done by the script
if not described differently.

We strongly recommend to set an error callback function (see
`rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction`) when porting to Embree 3 to detect all
runtime errors early.

Device
------

-   `rtcInit` and `rtcExit` got removed. Please use the device concept
    using the `rtcNewDevice` and `rtcReleaseDevice` functions instead.

-   Functions that conceptually should operate on a device but did not
    get a device argument got removed. The upgrade script replaces
    these functions by the proper functions that operate on a device,
    however, manually propagating the device handle to these function
    calls might still be required.

Scene
-----

-   The API no longer distinguishes between a static and a dynamic
    scene. Some users had issues as they wanted to do minor
    modifications to static scenes, but maintain high traversal
    performance.

    The new approach gives more flexibility, as each scene is
    changeable, and build quality settings can be changed on a commit
    basis to balance between build performance and render performance.

-   The `rtcCommitThread` function got removed; use
    `rtcJoinCommitScene` instead.

-   The scene now supports different build quality settings. Please use
    those instead of the previous way of `RTC_SCENE_STATIC`,
    `RTC_SCENE_DYNAMIC`, and `RTC_SCENE_HIGH_QUALITY` flags.

Geometry
--------

-   There is now only one `rtcNewGeometry` function to create
    geometries which gets passed an enum to specify the type of
    geometry to create. The number of vertices and primitives of the
    geometries is inferred from the size of data buffers.

-   We introduced an object type `RTCGeometry` for all geometries.
    Previously a geometry was not a standalone object and could only
    exist inside a scene. The new approach comes with more flexibility
    and more readable code.

    Operations like `rtcInterpolate` can now be performed on the
    geometry object directly without the need of a scene. Further, an
    application can choose to create its geometries independent of a
    scene, e.g. each time a geometry node is added to its scene graph.

    This modification changed many API functions to get passed one
    `RTCGeometry` object instead of a `RTCScene` and `geomID`. The
    script does all required changed automatically. However, in some
    cases the script may introduce `rtcGetGeometry(scene, geomID)`
    calls to retrieve the geometry handle. Best store the geometry
    handle inside your scene representation (and release it in the
    destructor) and access the handle directly instead of calling
    `rtcGetGeometry`.

-   Geometries are not included inside a scene anymore but can be
    attached to a multiple scenes using the `rtcAttachGeomety` or
    `rtcAttachGeometryByID` functions.

-   As geometries are separate objects, commit semantics got introduced
    for them too. Thus geometries must be committed through the
    `rtcCommitGeometry` call before getting used. This allows for
    earlier error checking and pre-calculating internal data per
    geometry object.

    Such commit points were previously not required in the Embree 2
    API. The upgrade script attempts to insert the commits
    automatically, but cannot do so properly under all circumstances.
    Thus please check if every `rtcCommitGeometry` call inserted by the
    script is properly placed, and if a `rtcCommitGeometry` call is
    placed after a sequence of changes to a geometry.

-   Only the latest version of the previous displacement function call
    (`RTCDisplacementFunc2`) is now supported, and the callback is
    passed as a structure containing all arguments.

-   The deprecated `RTCBoundaryMode` type and `rtcSetBoundaryMode`
    function got removed and replaced by `RTCSubdivisionMode` enum and
    the `rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode` function. The script does this
    replacement automatically.

-   Ribbon curves and lines now avoid self-intersections automatically
    The application can be simplified by removing special code paths
    that previously did the self-intersection handling.

-   The previous Embree 2 way of instancing was suboptimal as it
    required user geometries to update the `instID` field of the ray
    differently when used inside an instanced scene or inside a
    top-level scene. The user geometry intersection code now just has
    to copy the `context.instID` field into the `ray.instID` field to
    function properly under all circumstances.

-   The internal instancing code will update the `context.instID` field
    properly when entering or leaving an instance. When instancing is
    implemented manually through user geometries, the code must be
    modified to set the `context.instID` field properly and no longer
    pass `instID` through the ray. This change must done manually and
    cannot be performed by the script.

-   We flipped the direction of the geometry normal to the widely used
    convention that a shape with counter-clockwise layout of vertices
    has the normal pointing upwards (right-hand rule). Most modeling
    tools follow that convention.

    The conversion script does not perform this change, thus if
    required adjust your code to flip `Ng` for triangle, quad, and
    subdivision surfaces.

Buffers
-------

-   With Embree 3 we are introducing explicit `RTCBuffer` objects.
    However, you can still use the short way of sharing buffers with
    Embree through the `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` call.

-   The `rtcMapBuffer` and `rtcUnmapBuffer` API calls were removed, and
    we added the `rtcGetBufferData` call instead.

    Previously the `rtcMapBuffer` call had the semantics of creating an
    internal buffer when no buffer was shared for the corresponding
    buffer slot. These invocations of `rtcMapBuffer` must be replaced
    by an explicit creation of an internally managed buffer using the
    `rtcNewGeometryBuffer` function.

    The upgrade script cannot always detect if the `rtcMapBuffer` call
    would create an internal buffer or just map the buffer pointer.
    Thus check whether the `rtcNewGeometryBuffer` and
    `rtcGetBufferData` calls are correct after the conversion.

-   The `rtcUpdateGeometryBuffer` function now must be called for every
    buffer that got modified by the application. Note that the
    conversion script cannot automatically detect each location where a
    buffer update is now required.

-   The buffer type no longer encodes the time step or user vertex
    buffer index. Now `RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER_TYPE` and additional `slot`
    specifies the vertex buffer for a specific time step, and
    `RTC_USER_VERTEX_BUFFER_TYPE` and additional `slot` specifies a
    vertex attribute.

Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous}
-------------

-   The header files for Embree 3 are now inside the `embree3` folder
    (instead of `embree2` folder) and `libembree.so` is now called
    `libembree3.so` to be able to install multiple Embree versions side
    by side. We made the headers C99 compliant.

-   All API objects are now reference counted with release functions to
    decrement and retain functions to increment the reference count (if
    required).

-   Most callback functions no longer get different arguments as input,
    but a pointer to a structure containing all arguments. This results
    in more readable code, faster callback invocation (as some
    arguments do not change between invocations) and is extensible, as
    new members to the structure can be later added in a backward
    compatible way (if required).

    The conversion script can convert the definition and declaration of
    the old callback functions in most cases. Before running the
    script, make sure that you never type-cast a callback function when
    assigning it (as this has the danger of assigning a callback
    function with a wrong type if the conversion did not detect some
    callbacks as such). If the script does not detect a callback
    function, make sure the argument types match exactly the types in
    the header (e.g. write `const int` instead of `int const` or
    convert the callback manually).

-   An intersection context is now required for each ray query
    invocation. The context should be initialized using the
    `rtcInitIntersectContext` function.

-   The `rtcIntersect`-type functions get as input an `RTCRayHit` type,
    which is similar to before, but has the ray and hit parts split
    into two sub-structures.

    The `rtcOccluded`-type functions get as input an `RTCRay` type,
    which does not contain hit data anymore. When an occlusion is
    found, the `tfar` element of the ray is set to `-inf`.

    Required code changes cannot be done by the upgrade script and need
    to be done manually.

-   The ray layout for single rays and packets of rays had certain
    incompatibilities (alignment of `org` and `dir` for single rays
    caused gaps in the single ray layout that were not in the ray
    packet layout). This issue never showed up because single rays and
    ray packets were separate in the system initially. This layout
    issue is now fixed, and a single ray has the same layout as a ray
    packet of size 1.

-   Previously Embree supported placing additional data at the end of
    the ray structure, and accessing that data inside user geometry
    callbacks and filter callback functions.

    With Embree 3 this is no longer supported, and the ray passed to a
    callback function may be copied to a different memory location. To
    attach additional data to your ray, simply extend the intersection
    context with a pointer to that data.

    This change cannot be done by the script. Further, code will still
    work if you extend the ray as the implementation did not change
    yet.

-   The ray structure now contains an additional `id` and `flags`
    field. The `id` can be used to store the index of the ray with
    respect to a ray packet or ray stream. The `flags` is reserved for
    future use, and currently must be set to 0.

-   All previous intersection filter callback variants have been
    removed, except for the `RTCFilterFuncN` which gets a varying size
    ray packet as input. The semantics of this filter function type
    have changed from copying the hit on acceptance to clearing the
    ray's valid argument in case of non-acceptance. This way, chaining
    multiple filters is more efficient.

    We kept the guarantee that for `rtcIntersect1/4/8/16` and
    `rtcOccluded1/4/8/16` calls the packet size and ray order will not
    change from the initial size and ordering when entering a filter
    callback.

-   We no longer export Intel® ISPC-specific symbols. This has the
    advantage that certain linking issues went away, e.g. it is now
    possible to link an Intel® ISPC application compiled for any
    combination of ISAs, and link this to an Embree library compiled
    with a different set of ISAs. Previously the ISAs of the
    application had to be a subset of the ISAs of Embree, and when the
    user enabled exactly one ISA, they had to do this in Embree and the
    application.

-   We no longer export the Intel® ISPC tasking system, which means
    that the application has the responsibility to implement the Intel®
    ISPC tasking system itself. Intel® ISPC comes with example code on
    how to do this. This change is not performed by the script and must
    be done manually.

-   Fixed many naming inconsistencies, and changed names of further API
    functions. All these renamings are properly done by the script and
    need no further attention.



Embree API Reference
====================

rtcNewDevice
------------

#### NAME

    rtcNewDevice - creates a new device

#### SYNOPSIS

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCDevice rtcNewDevice(const char* config);

#### DESCRIPTION

This function creates a new device and returns a handle to this device.
The device object is reference counted with an initial reference count
of 1. The handle can be released using the `rtcReleaseDevice` API call.

The device object acts as a class factory for all other object types.
All objects created from the device (like scenes, geometries, etc.)
hold a reference to the device, thus the device will not be destroyed
unless these objects are destroyed first.

Objects are only compatible if they belong to the same device, e.g it
is not allowed to create a geometry in one device and attach it to a
scene created with a different device.

A configuration string (`config` argument) can be passed to the device
construction. This configuration string can be `NULL` to use the
default configuration.

The following configuration is supported:

-   `threads=[int]`: Specifies a number of build threads to use. A
    value of 0 enables all detected hardware threads. By default all
    hardware threads are used.

-   `user_threads=[int]`: Sets the number of user threads that can be
    used to join and participate in a scene commit using
    `rtcJoinCommitScene`. The tasking system will only use
    threads-user\_threads many worker threads, thus if the app wants to
    solely use its threads to commit scenes, just set threads equal to
    user\_threads. This option only has effect with the Intel(R)
    Threading Building Blocks (TBB) tasking system.

-   `set_affinity=[0/1]`: When enabled, build threads are affinitized
    to hardware threads. This option is disabled by default on standard
    CPUs, and enabled by default on Xeon Phi Processors.

-   `start_threads=[0/1]`: When enabled, the build threads are started
    upfront. This can be useful for benchmarking to exclude thread
    creation time. This option is disabled by default.

-   `isa=[sse2,sse4.2,avx,avx2,avx512]`: Use specified ISA. By default
    the ISA is selected automatically.

-   `max_isa=[sse2,sse4.2,avx,avx2,avx512]`: Configures the automated
    ISA selection to use maximally the specified ISA.

-   `hugepages=[0/1]`: Enables or disables usage of huge pages. Under
    Linux huge pages are used by default but under Windows and macOS
    they are disabled by default.

-   `enable_selockmemoryprivilege=[0/1]`: When set to 1, this enables
    the `SeLockMemoryPrivilege` privilege with is required to use huge
    pages on Windows. This option has an effect only under Windows and
    is ignored on other platforms. See Section [Huge Page Support]
    for more details.

-   `verbose=[0,1,2,3]`: Sets the verbosity of the output. When set to
    0, no output is printed by Embree, when set to a higher level more
    output is printed. By default Embree does not print anything on the
    console.

-   `frequency_level=[simd128,simd256,simd512]`: Specifies the
    frequency level the application want to run on, which can be
    either:
    a)  simd128 to run at highest frequency
    b)  simd256 to run at AVX2-heavy frequency level
    c)  simd512 to run at heavy AVX512 frequency level. When some
        frequency level is specified, Embree will avoid doing
        optimizations that may reduce the frequency level below the
        level specified. E.g. if your app does not use AVX instructions
        setting "frequency\_level=simd128" will cause some CPUs to run
        at highest frequency, which may result in higher application
        performance if you do much shading. If you application heavily
        uses AVX code, you should best set the frequency level to
        simd256. Per default Embree tries to avoid reducing the
        frequency of the CPU by setting the simd256 level only when the
        CPU has no significant down clocking.

Different configuration options should be separated by commas, e.g.:

    rtcNewDevice("threads=1,isa=avx");

#### EXIT STATUS

On success returns a handle of the created device. On failure returns
`NULL` as device and sets a per-thread error code that can be queried
using `rtcGetDeviceError(NULL)`.

#### SEE ALSO

rtcRetainDevice
---------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcRetainDevice - increments the device reference count

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcRetainDevice(RTCDevice device);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Device objects are reference counted. The `rtcRetainDevice` function
increments the reference count of the passed device object (`device`
argument). This function together with `rtcReleaseDevice` allows to use
the internal reference counting in a C++ wrapper class to manage the
ownership of the object.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.

#### SEE ALSO {#see-also}

[rtcNewDevice], [rtcReleaseDevice]



rtcReleaseDevice
----------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcReleaseDevice - decrements the device reference count

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcReleaseDevice(RTCDevice device);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Device objects are reference counted. The `rtcReleaseDevice` function
decrements the reference count of the passed device object (`device`
argument). When the reference count falls to 0, the device gets
destroyed.

All objects created from the device (like scenes, geometries, etc.)
hold a reference to the device, thus the device will not get destroyed
unless these objects are destroyed first.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.

#### SEE ALSO {#see-also}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    ssize_t rtcGetDeviceProperty(
      RTCDevice device,
      enum RTCDeviceProperty prop

    Embree is compiled with. Possible return values are:

    0.  internal tasking system
    1.  Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB)
    2.  Parallel Patterns Library (PPL)

-   `RTC_DEVICE_PROPERTY_JOIN_COMMIT_SUPPORTED`: Queries whether
    `rtcJoinCommitScene` is supported. This is not the case when Embree
    is compiled with PPL or older versions of TBB.

    concurrently. This feature is only supported starting with TBB 2019
    Update 9.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On success returns the value of the queried property. For properties
returning a boolean value, the return value 0 denotes `false` and 1
denotes `true`.

On failure zero is returned and an error code is set that can be
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.



rtcGetDeviceError
-----------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcGetDeviceError - returns the error code of the device

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCError rtcGetDeviceError(RTCDevice device);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Each thread has its own error code per device. If an error occurs when
calling an API function, this error code is set to the occurred error
if it stores no previous error. The `rtcGetDeviceError` function reads
and returns the currently stored error and clears the error code. This
assures that the returned error code is always the first error occurred
since the last invocation of `rtcGetDeviceError`.

Possible error codes returned by `rtcGetDeviceError` are:

-   `RTC_ERROR_NONE`: No error occurred.

-   `RTC_ERROR_UNKNOWN`: An unknown error has occurred.

-   `RTC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`: An invalid argument was specified.

-   `RTC_ERROR_INVALID_OPERATION`: The operation is not allowed for the
    specified object.

-   `RTC_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`: There is not enough memory left to
    complete the operation.

-   `RTC_ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_CPU`: The CPU is not supported as it does
    not support the lowest ISA Embree is compiled for.

-   `RTC_ERROR_CANCELLED`: The operation got canceled by a memory
    monitor callback or progress monitor callback function.

When the device construction fails, `rtcNewDevice` returns `NULL` as
device. To detect the error code of a such a failed device
construction, pass `NULL` as device to the `rtcGetDeviceError`
function. For all other invocations of `rtcGetDeviceError`, a proper

rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction
-------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction - sets an error callback function for the device

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    typedef void (*RTCErrorFunction)(
      void* userPtr,
      RTCError code,
      const char* str
    );

    void rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction(
      RTCDevice device,
      RTCErrorFunction error,
      void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Using the `rtcSetDeviceErrorFunction` call, it is possible to set a
callback function (`error` argument) with payload (`userPtr` argument),
which is called whenever an error occurs for the specified device
(`device` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per device, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

When the registered callback function is invoked, it gets passed the
user-defined payload (`userPtr` argument as specified at registration
time), the error code (`code` argument) of the occurred error, as well
as a string (`str` argument) that further describes the error.

The error code is also set if an error callback function is registered.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.

rtcSetDeviceMemoryMonitorFunction
---------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetDeviceMemoryMonitorFunction - registers a callback function
      to track memory consumption

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    typedef bool (*RTCMemoryMonitorFunction)(
      void* userPtr,
      ssize_t bytes,
      bool post
    );

    void rtcSetDeviceMemoryMonitorFunction(
      RTCDevice device,
      RTCMemoryMonitorFunction memoryMonitor,
      void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Using the `rtcSetDeviceMemoryMonitorFunction` call, it is possible to
register a callback function (`memoryMonitor` argument) with payload
(`userPtr` argument) for a device (`device` argument), which is called
whenever internal memory is allocated or deallocated by objects of that
device. Using this memory monitor callback mechanism, the application
can track the memory consumption of an Embree device, and optionally
terminate API calls that consume too much memory.

Only a single callback function can be registered per device, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

Once registered, the Embree device will invoke the memory monitor
callback function before or after it allocates or frees important
memory blocks. The callback function gets passed the payload as
specified at registration time (`userPtr` argument), the number of
bytes allocated or deallocated (`bytes` argument), and whether the
callback is invoked after the allocation or deallocation took place
(`post` argument). The callback function might get called from multiple
threads concurrently.

The application can track the current memory usage of the Embree device
by atomically accumulating the `bytes` input parameter provided to the
callback function. This parameter will be \>0 for allocations and \<0
for deallocations.

Embree will continue its operation normally when returning `true` from
the callback function. If `false` is returned, Embree will cancel the
current operation with the `RTC_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` error code.
Issuing multiple cancel requests from different threads is allowed.
Canceling will only happen when the callback was called for allocations
(bytes \> 0), otherwise the cancel request will be ignored.

If a callback to cancel was invoked before the allocation happens
(`post == false`), then the `bytes` parameter should not be
accumulated, as the allocation will never happen. If the callback to
cancel was invoked after the allocation happened (`post == true`), then
the `bytes` parameter should be accumulated, as the allocation properly
happened and a deallocation will later free that data block.

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcNewScene - creates a new scene

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCScene rtcNewScene(RTCDevice device);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

This function creates a new scene bound to the specified device
(`device` argument), and returns a handle to this scene. The scene
object is reference counted with an initial reference count of 1. The
scene handle can be released using the `rtcReleaseScene` API call.

    RTCDevice rtcGetSceneDevice(RTCScene scene);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

This function returns the device object the scene got created in. The
returned handle own one additional reference to the device object, thus
you should need to call `rtcReleaseDevice` when the returned handle is
no longer required.

    void rtcRetainScene(RTCScene scene);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Scene objects are reference counted. The `rtcRetainScene` function
increments the reference count of the passed scene object (`scene`
argument). This function together with `rtcReleaseScene` allows to use
the internal reference counting in a C++ wrapper class to handle the
ownership of the object.

    void rtcReleaseScene(RTCScene scene);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Scene objects are reference counted. The `rtcReleaseScene` function
decrements the reference count of the passed scene object (`scene`
argument). When the reference count falls to 0, the scene gets
destroyed.

The scene holds a reference to all attached geometries, thus if the
scene gets destroyed, all geometries get detached and their reference
count decremented.

rtcAttachGeometry
-----------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcAttachGeometry - attaches a geometry to the scene

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    unsigned int rtcAttachGeometry(
      RTCScene scene,
      RTCGeometry geometry
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcAttachGeometry` function attaches a geometry (`geometry`
argument) to a scene (`scene` argument) and assigns a geometry ID to
that geometry. All geometries attached to a scene are defined to be
included inside the scene. A geometry can get attached to multiple
scenes. The geometry ID is unique for the scene, and is used to
identify the geometry when hit by a ray during ray queries.

This function is thread-safe, thus multiple threads can attach
geometries to a scene in parallel.

The geometry IDs are assigned sequentially, starting from 0, as long as
no geometry got detached. If geometries got detached, the
implementation will reuse IDs in an implementation dependent way.
Consequently sequential assignment is no longer guaranteed, but a
compact range of IDs.

These rules allow the application to manage a dynamic array to
efficiently map from geometry IDs to its own geometry representation.
Alternatively, the application can also use per-geometry user data to
map to its geometry representation. See `rtcSetGeometryUserData` and
`rtcGetGeometryUserData` for more information.

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using

rtcAttachGeometryByID
---------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcAttachGeometryByID - attaches a geometry to the scene
      using a specified geometry ID

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcAttachGeometryByID(
      RTCScene scene,
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      unsigned int geomID
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcAttachGeometryByID` function attaches a geometry (`geometry`
argument) to a scene (`scene` argument) and assigns a user provided
geometry ID (`geomID` argument) to that geometry. All geometries
attached to a scene are defined to be included inside the scene. A
geometry can get attached to multiple scenes. The passed user-defined
geometry ID is used to identify the geometry when hit by a ray during
ray queries. Using this function, it is possible to share the same IDs
to refer to geometries inside the application and Embree.

This function is thread-safe, thus multiple threads can attach
geometries to a scene in parallel.

The user-provided geometry ID must be unused in the scene, otherwise
the creation of the geometry will fail. Further, the user-provided
geometry IDs should be compact, as Embree internally creates a vector
which size is equal to the largest geometry ID used. Creating very
large geometry IDs for small scenes would thus cause a memory
consumption and performance overhead.

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.

    void rtcDetachGeometry(RTCScene scene, unsigned int geomID);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

This function detaches a geometry identified by its geometry ID
(`geomID` argument) from a scene (`scene` argument). When detached, the
geometry is no longer contained in the scene.

This function is thread-safe, thus multiple threads can detach
geometries from a scene at the same time.

      the specified geometry ID

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry rtcGetGeometry(RTCScene scene, unsigned int geomID);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcGetGeometry` function returns the geometry that is bound to the
specified geometry ID (`geomID` argument) for the specified scene
(`scene` argument). This function just looks up the handle and does
*not* increment the reference count. If you want to get ownership of
the handle, you need to additionally call `rtcRetainGeometry`.

This function is not thread safe and thus can be used during rendering.
However, it is generally recommended to store the geometry handle
inside the application's geometry representation and look up the
geometry handle from that representation directly.

If you need a thread safe version of this function please use
[rtcGetGeometryThreadSafe].

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcGetGeometryThreadSafe` function returns the geometry that is
bound to the specified geometry ID (`geomID` argument) for the
specified scene (`scene` argument). This function just looks up the
handle and does *not* increment the reference count. If you want to get
ownership of the handle, you need to additionally call
`rtcRetainGeometry`.

This function is thread safe and should NOT get used during rendering.
If you need a fast non-thread safe version during rendering please use
the [rtcGetGeometry] function.

rtcCommitScene
--------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcCommitScene - commits scene changes

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcCommitScene(RTCScene scene);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcCommitScene` function commits all changes for the specified
scene (`scene` argument). This internally triggers building of a
spatial acceleration structure for the scene using all available worker
threads. Ray queries can be performed only after committing all scene
changes.

If the application uses TBB 2019 Update 9 or later for parallelization
of rendering, lazy scene construction during rendering is supported by
`rtcCommitScene`. Therefore `rtcCommitScene` can get called from
multiple TBB worker threads concurrently for the same scene. The
`rtcCommitScene` function will then internally isolate the scene
construction using a tbb::isolated\_task\_group. The alternative
approach of using `rtcJoinCommitScene` which uses an tbb:task\_arena
internally, is not recommended due to it's high runtime overhead.

If scene geometries get modified or attached or detached, the
`rtcCommitScene` call must be invoked before performing any further ray
queries for the scene; otherwise the effect of the ray query is
undefined. The modification of a geometry, committing the scene, and
tracing of rays must always happen sequentially, and never at the same
time. Any API call that sets a property of the scene or geometries
contained in the scene count as scene modification, e.g. including
setting of intersection filter functions.

The kind of acceleration structure built can be influenced using scene
flags (see `rtcSetSceneFlags`), and the quality can be specified using
the `rtcSetSceneBuildQuality` function.

Embree silently ignores primitives during spatial acceleration
structure construction that would cause numerical issues,
e.g. primitives containing NaNs, INFs, or values greater than 1.844E18f
(as no reasonable calculations can be performed with such values
without causing overflows).

On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
`rtcGetDeviceError`.

[rtcJoinCommitScene]



rtcJoinCommitScene
------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcJoinCommitScene - commits the scene from multiple threads

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcJoinCommitScene(RTCScene scene);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcJoinCommitScene` function commits all changes for the specified
scene (`scene` argument). The scene commit internally triggers building
of a spatial acceleration structure for the scene. Ray queries can be
performed after scene changes got properly committed.

The `rtcJoinCommitScene` function can get called from multiple user
threads which will all cooperate in the build operation. All threads
calling into this function will return from `rtcJoinCommitScene` after
the scene commit is finished. All threads must consistently call
`rtcJoinCommitScene` and not `rtcCommitScene`.

In contrast to the `rtcCommitScene` function, the `rtcJoinCommitScene`
function can be called from multiple user threads, while the
`rtcCommitScene` can only get called from multiple TBB worker threads
when used concurrently. For optimal performance we strongly recommend
using TBB inside the application together with the `rtcCommitScene`
function and to avoid using the `rtcJoinCommitScene` function.

The `rtcJoinCommitScene` feature allows a flexible way to lazily create
hierarchies during rendering. A thread reaching a not-yet-constructed
sub-scene of a two-level scene can generate the sub-scene geometry and
call `rtcJoinCommitScene` on that just generated scene. During
construction, further threads reaching the not-yet-built scene can join
the build operation by also invoking `rtcJoinCommitScene`. A thread
that calls `rtcJoinCommitScene` after the build finishes will directly
return from the `rtcJoinCommitScene` call.

Multiple scene commit operations on different scenes can be running at
the same time, hence it is possible to commit many small scenes in
parallel, distributing the commits to many threads.

When using Embree with the Intel® Threading Building Blocks (which is
the default), threads that call `rtcJoinCommitScene` will join the
build operation, but other TBB worker threads might also participate in
the build. To avoid thread oversubscription, we recommend using TBB
also inside the application. Further, the join mode only works properly
starting with TBB v4.4 Update 1. For earlier TBB versions, threads that
call `rtcJoinCommitScene` to join a running build will just trigger the
build and wait for the build to finish. Further, old TBB versions with
`TBB_INTERFACE_VERSION_MAJOR < 8` do not support `rtcJoinCommitScene`,
and invoking this function will result in an error.

When using Embree with the internal tasking system, only threads that
call `rtcJoinCommitScene` will perform the build operation, and no
additional worker threads will be scheduled.

When using Embree with the Parallel Patterns Library (PPL),
`rtcJoinCommitScene` is not supported and calling that function will
result in an error.

To detect whether `rtcJoinCommitScene` is supported, use the
`rtcGetDeviceProperty` function.

rtcSetSceneProgressMonitorFunction
----------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetSceneProgressMonitorFunction - registers a callback
      to track build progress

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    typedef bool (*RTCProgressMonitorFunction)(
      void* ptr,
      double n
    );

    void rtcSetSceneProgressMonitorFunction(
      RTCScene scene,
      RTCProgressMonitorFunction progress,
      void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Embree supports a progress monitor callback mechanism that can be used
to report progress of hierarchy build operations and to cancel build
operations.

The `rtcSetSceneProgressMonitorFunction` registers a progress monitor
callback function (`progress` argument) with payload (`userPtr`
argument) for the specified scene (`scene` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per scene, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

Once registered, Embree will invoke the callback function multiple
times during hierarchy build operations of the scene, by passing the
payload as set at registration time (`userPtr` argument), and a double
in the range $[0, 1]$ which estimates the progress of the operation
(`n` argument). The callback function might be called from multiple
threads concurrently.

When returning `true` from the callback function, Embree will continue
the build operation normally. When returning `false`, Embree will
cancel the build operation with the `RTC_ERROR_CANCELLED` error code.
Issuing multiple cancel requests for the same build operation is
allowed.

    void rtcSetSceneBuildQuality(
      RTCScene scene,
      enum RTCBuildQuality quality
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetSceneBuildQuality` function sets the build quality
(`quality` argument) for the specified scene (`scene` argument).
Possible values for the build quality are:

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_LOW`: Create lower quality data structures,
    e.g. for dynamic scenes. A two-level spatial index structure is
    built when enabling this mode, which supports fast partial scene
    updates, and allows for setting a per-geometry build quality
    through the `rtcSetGeometryBuildQuality` function.

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_MEDIUM`: Default build quality for most usages.
    Gives a good compromise between build and render performance.

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_HIGH`: Create higher quality data structures for
    final-frame rendering. For certain geometry types this enables a
    spatial split BVH.

Selecting a higher build quality results in better rendering
performance but slower scene commit times. The default build quality
for a scene is `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_MEDIUM`.

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    void rtcSetSceneFlags(RTCScene scene, enum RTCSceneFlags flags);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetSceneFlags` function sets the scene flags (`flags` argument)
for the specified scene (`scene` argument). Possible scene flags are:

-   `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_NONE`: No flags set.

-   `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_DYNAMIC`: Provides better build performance for
    dynamic scenes (but also higher memory consumption).

-   `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_COMPACT`: Uses compact acceleration structures and
    avoids algorithms that consume much memory.

-   `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_ROBUST`: Uses acceleration structures that allow
    for robust traversal, and avoids optimizations that reduce
    arithmetic accuracy. This mode is typically used for avoiding
    artifacts caused by rays shooting through edges of neighboring
    primitives.

-   `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_CONTEXT_FILTER_FUNCTION`: Enables support for a
    filter function inside the intersection context for this scene. See
    Section [rtcInitIntersectContext] for more details.

Multiple flags can be enabled using an `or` operation,
e.g. `RTC_SCENE_FLAG_COMPACT | RTC_SCENE_FLAG_ROBUST`.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcGetSceneBounds` function queries the axis-aligned bounding box
of the specified scene (`scene` argument) and stores that bounding box
to the provided destination pointer (`bounds_o` argument). The stored
bounding box consists of lower and upper bounds for the x, y, and z

      struct RTCLinearBounds* bounds_o
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcGetSceneLinearBounds` function queries the linear bounds of the
specified scene (`scene` argument) and stores them to the provided
destination pointer (`bounds_o` argument). The stored linear bounds
consist of bounding boxes for time 0 (`bounds0` member) and time 1
(`bounds1` member) as specified by the `RTCLinearBounds` structure.
Linearly interpolating these bounds to a specific time `t` yields
bounds for the geometry at that time.

The provided destination pointer must be aligned to 16 bytes. The

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Geometries are objects that represent an array of primitives of the
same type. The `rtcNewGeometry` function creates a new geometry of
specified type (`type` argument) bound to the specified device
(`device` argument) and returns a handle to this geometry. The geometry
object is reference counted with an initial reference count of 1. The
geometry handle can be released using the `rtcReleaseGeometry` API
call.

Supported geometry types are triangle meshes
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE` type), quad meshes (triangle pairs)
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD` type), Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION` type), curve geometries with different
bases (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_LINEAR_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_BEZIER_CURVE`,\

`RTC_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT`), user-defined geometries
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER`), and instances
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE`).

The types `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_BEZIER_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_BSPLINE_CURVE`, and
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_CATMULL_ROM_CURVE` will treat the curve as a
sweep surface of a varying-radius circle swept tangentially along the
curve. The types `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_BEZIER_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_BSPLINE_CURVE`, and
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_CATMULL_ROM_CURVE` use ray-facing ribbons as a
faster-to-intersect approximation.

After construction, geometries are enabled by default and not attached
to any scene. Geometries can be disabled (`rtcDisableGeometry` call),
and enabled again (`rtcEnableGeometry` call). A geometry can be
attached to multiple scenes using the `rtcAttachGeometry` call (or
`rtcAttachGeometryByID` call), and detached using the
`rtcDetachGeometry` call. During attachment, a geometry ID is assigned
to the geometry (or assigned by the user when using the
`rtcAttachGeometryByID` call), which uniquely identifies the geometry
inside that scene. This identifier is returned when primitives of the
geometry are hit in later ray queries for the scene.

Geometries can also be modified, including their vertex and index
buffers. After modifying a buffer, `rtcUpdateGeometryBuffer` must be
called to notify that the buffer got modified.

The application can use the `rtcSetGeometryUserData` function to set a
user data pointer to its own geometry representation, and later read
out this pointer using the `rtcGetGeometryUserData` function.

After setting up the geometry or modifying it, `rtcCommitGeometry` must
be called to finish the geometry setup. After committing the geometry,
vertex data interpolation can be performed using the `rtcInterpolate`
and `rtcInterpolateN` functions.

A build quality can be specified for a geometry using the
`rtcSetGeometryBuildQuality` function, to balance between acceleration
structure build performance and ray query performance. The build
quality per geometry will be used if a two-level acceleration structure
is built internally, which is the case if the `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_LOW`
is set as the scene build quality. See Section
[rtcSetSceneBuildQuality] for more details.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_TRIANGLE
-----------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE - triangle geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
      rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Triangle meshes are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE` to
the `rtcNewGeometry` function call. The triangle indices can be
specified by setting an index buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` type) and
the triangle vertices by setting a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` type). See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more details on how to set buffers.
The index buffer must contain an array of three 32-bit indices per
triangle (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT3` format) and the number of primitives is
inferred from the size of that buffer. The vertex buffer must contain
an array of single precision `x`, `y`, `z` floating point coordinates
(`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` format), and the number of vertices are inferred
from the size of that buffer. The vertex buffer can be at most 16 GB
large.

The parametrization of a triangle uses the first vertex `p0` as base
point, the vector `p1 - p0` as u-direction and the vector `p2 - p0` as
v-direction. Thus vertex attributes `t0,t1,t2` can be linearly
interpolated over the triangle the following way:

    t_uv = (1-u-v)*t0 + u*t1 + v*t2
         = t0 + u*(t1-t0) + v*(t2-t0)

A triangle whose vertices are laid out counter-clockwise has its
geometry normal pointing upwards outside the front face, like
illustrated in the following picture:

![][imgTriangleUV]

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers have to have the same stride and size.

Also see tutorial [Triangle Geometry] for an example of how to create
triangle meshes.

On failure `NULL` is returned and an error code is set that be get
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_QUAD
-------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD - quad geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
      rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Quad meshes are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD` to the
`rtcNewGeometry` function call. The quad indices can be specified by
setting an index buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` type) and the quad
vertices by setting a vertex buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` type).
See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more
details on how to set buffers. The index buffer contains an array of
four 32-bit indices per quad (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT4` format), and the
number of primitives is inferred from the size of that buffer. The
vertex buffer contains an array of single precision `x`, `y`, `z`
floating point coordinates (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` format), and the number
of vertices is inferred from the size of that buffer. The vertex buffer
can be at most 16 GB large.

A quad is internally handled as a pair of two triangles `v0,v1,v3` and
`v2,v3,v1`, with the `u'`/`v'` coordinates of the second triangle
corrected by `u = 1-u'` and `v = 1-v'` to produce a quad
parametrization where `u` and `v` are in the range 0 to 1. Thus the
parametrization of a quad uses the first vertex `p0` as base point, and
the vector `p1 - p0` as `u`-direction, and `p3 - p0` as v-direction.
Thus vertex attributes `t0,t1,t2,t3` can be bilinearly interpolated
over the quadrilateral the following way:

    t_uv = (1-v)((1-u)*t0 + u*t1) + v*((1-u)*t3 + u*t2)

Mixed triangle/quad meshes are supported by encoding a triangle as a
quad, which can be achieved by replicating the last triangle vertex
(`v0,v1,v2` -\> `v0,v1,v2,v2`). This way the second triangle is a line
(which can never get hit), and the parametrization of the first
triangle is compatible with the standard triangle parametrization.

A quad whose vertices are laid out counter-clockwise has its geometry
normal pointing upwards outside the front face, like illustrated in the
following picture.

![][imgQuadUV]

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers must have the same stride and size.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_GRID
-------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_GRID - grid geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
      rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_GRID);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Grid meshes are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_GRID` to the
`rtcNewGeometry` function call, and contain an array of grid
primitives. This array of grids can be specified by setting up a grid
buffer (with `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_GRID` type and `RTC_FORMAT_GRID` format)
and the grid mesh vertices by setting a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` type). See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more details on how to set buffers.
The number of grid primitives in the grid mesh is inferred from the
size of the grid buffer.

The vertex buffer contains an array of single precision `x`, `y`, `z`
floating point coordinates (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` format), and the number
of vertices is inferred from the size of that buffer.

Each grid in the grid buffer is of the type `RTCGrid`:

    struct RTCGrid
    {
      unsigned int startVertexID;
      unsigned int stride;
      unsigned short width,height; 
    };

The `RTCGrid` structure describes a 2D grid of vertices (with respect
to the vertex buffer of the grid mesh). The `width` and `height`
members specify the number of vertices in u and v direction,
e.g. setting both `width` and `height` to 3 sets up a 3×3 vertex grid.
The maximum allowed `width` and `height` is 32767. The `startVertexID`
specifies the ID of the top-left vertex in the vertex grid, while the
`stride` parameter specifies a stride (in number of vertices) used to
step to the next row.

A vertex grid of dimensions `width` and `height` is treated as a
`(width-1)` x `(height-1)` grid of `quads` (triangle-pairs), with the
same shared edge handling as for regular quad meshes. However, the
`u`/`v` coordinates have the uniform range `[0..1]` for an entire
vertex grid. The `u` direction follows the `width` of the grid while
the `v` direction the `height`.

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers must have the same stride and size.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure `NULL` is returned and an error code is set that can be
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_SUBDIVISION
--------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION - subdivision geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
      rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Catmull-Clark subdivision meshes are supported, including support for
edge creases, vertex creases, holes, non-manifold geometry, and
face-varying interpolation. The number of vertices per face can be in
the range of 3 to 15 vertices (triangles, quadrilateral, pentagons,
etc).

Subdivision meshes are created by passing
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION` to the `rtcNewGeometry` function.
Various buffers need to be set by the application to set up the
subdivision mesh. See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more details on how to set buffers.
The face buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FACE` type and `RTC_FORMAT_UINT`
format) contains the number of edges/indices of each face (3 to 15),
and the number of faces is inferred from the size of this buffer. The
index buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` type) contains multiple (3 to 15)
32-bit vertex indices (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT` format) for each face, and the
number of edges is inferred from the size of this buffer. The vertex
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` type) stores an array of single
precision `x`, `y`, `z` floating point coordinates (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3`
format), and the number of vertices is inferred from the size of this
buffer.

Optionally, the application may set additional index buffers using
different buffer slots if multiple topologies are required for
face-varying interpolation. The standard vertex buffers
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX`) are always bound to the geometry topology
(topology 0) thus use `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` with buffer slot 0. User
vertex data interpolation may use different topologies as described
later.

Optionally, the application can set up the hole buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_HOLE`) which contains an array of 32-bit indices
(`RTC_FORMAT_UINT` format) of faces that should be considered
non-existing in all topologies. The number of holes is inferred from
the size of this buffer.

Optionally, the application can fill the level buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_LEVEL`) with a tessellation rate for each of the
edges of each face. This buffer must have the same size as the index
buffer. The tessellation level is a positive floating point value
(`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT` format) that specifies how many quads along the
edge should be generated during tessellation. If no level buffer is
specified, a level of 1 is used. The maximally supported edge level is
4096, and larger levels are clamped to that value. Note that edges may
be shared between (typically 2) faces. To guarantee a watertight
tessellation, the level of these shared edges should be identical. A
uniform tessellation rate for an entire subdivision mesh can be set by
using the `rtcSetGeometryTessellationRate` function. The existence of a
level buffer has precedence over the uniform tessellation rate.

Optionally, the application can fill the sparse edge crease buffers to
make edges appear sharper. The edge crease index buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_INDEX`) contains an array of pairs of
32-bit vertex indices (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT2` format) that specify
unoriented edges in the geometry topology. The edge crease weight
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_WEIGHT`) stores for each of these
crease edges a positive floating point weight (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT`
format). The number of edge creases is inferred from the size of these
buffers, which has to be identical. The larger a weight, the sharper
the edge. Specifying a weight of infinity is supported and marks an
edge as infinitely sharp. Storing an edge multiple times with the same
crease weight is allowed, but has lower performance. Storing an edge
multiple times with different crease weights results in undefined
behavior. For a stored edge (i,j), the reverse direction edges (j,i) do
not have to be stored, as both are considered the same unoriented edge.
Edge crease features are shared between all topologies.

Optionally, the application can fill the sparse vertex crease buffers
to make vertices appear sharper. The vertex crease index buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_INDEX`), contains an array of 32-bit
vertex indices (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT` format) to specify a set of vertices
from the geometry topology. The vertex crease weight buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_WEIGHT`) specifies for each of these
vertices a positive floating point weight (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT` format).
The number of vertex creases is inferred from the size of these
buffers, and has to be identical. The larger a weight, the sharper the
vertex. Specifying a weight of infinity is supported and makes the
vertex infinitely sharp. Storing a vertex multiple times with the same
crease weight is allowed, but has lower performance. Storing a vertex
multiple times with different crease weights results in undefined
behavior. Vertex crease features are shared between all topologies.

Subdivision modes can be used to force linear interpolation for parts
of the subdivision mesh; see `rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode` for more
details.

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers have to have the same stride and size.

Also see tutorial [Subdivision Geometry] for an example of how to
create subdivision surfaces.

#### Parametrization

The parametrization for subdivision faces is different for
quadrilaterals and non-quadrilateral faces.

The parametrization of a quadrilateral face uses the first vertex `p0`
as base point, and the vector `p1 - p0` as u-direction and `p3 - p0` as
v-direction.

The parametrization for all other face types (with number of vertices
not equal 4), have a special parametrization where the subpatch ID `n`
(of the `n`-th quadrilateral that would be obtained by a single
subdivision step) and the local hit location inside this quadrilateral
are encoded in the UV coordinates. The following code extracts the
sub-patch ID `i` and local UVs of this subpatch:

    unsigned int l = floorf(0.5f*U);
    unsigned int h = floorf(0.5f*V);
    unsigned int i = 4*h+l;
    float u = 2.0f*fracf(0.5f*U)-0.5f;
    float v = 2.0f*fracf(0.5f*V)-0.5f;

This encoding allows local subpatch UVs to be in the range `[-0.5,1.5[`
thus negative subpatch UVs can be passed to `rtcInterpolate` to sample
subpatches slightly out of bounds. This can be useful to calculate
derivatives using finite differences if required. The encoding further
has the property that one can just move the value `u` (or `v`) on a
subpatch by adding `du` (or `dv`) to the special UV encoding as long as
it does not fall out of the `[-0.5,1.5[` range.

To smoothly interpolate vertex attributes over the subdivision surface
we recommend using the `rtcInterpolate` function, which will apply the
standard subdivision rules for interpolation and automatically takes
care of the special UV encoding for non-quadrilaterals.

#### Face-Varying Data

Face-varying interpolation is supported through multiple topologies per
subdivision mesh and binding such topologies to vertex attribute
buffers to interpolate. This way, texture coordinates may use a
different topology with additional boundaries to construct separate UV
regions inside one subdivision mesh.

Each such topology `i` has a separate index buffer (specified using
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` with buffer slot `i`) and separate subdivision
mode that can be set using `rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode`. A vertex
attribute buffer `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE` bound to a buffer
slot `j` can be assigned to use a topology for interpolation using the
`rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology` call.

The face buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FACE` type) is shared between all
topologies, which means that the `n`-th primitive always has the same
number of vertices (e.g. being a triangle or a quad) for each topology.
However, the indices of the topologies themselves may be different.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure `NULL` is returned and an error code is set that can be
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Curves with per vertex radii are supported with linear, cubic Bézier,
cubic B-spline, and cubic Hermite bases. Such curve geometries are
created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_LINEAR_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_BEZIER_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_BSPLINE_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_HERMITE_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_CATMULL_ROM_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_NORMAL_ORIENTED_FLAT_BEZIER_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_NORMAL_ORIENTED_FLAT_BSPLINE_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_NORMAL_ORIENTED_FLAT_HERMITE_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_NORMAL_ORIENTED_FLAT_CATMULL_ROM_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_CONE_LINEAR_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_LINEAR_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_BEZIER_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_BSPLINE_CURVE`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_HERMITE_CURVE`, or
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_CATMULL_ROM_CURVE` to the `rtcNewGeometry`
function. The curve indices can be specified through an index buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX`) and the curve vertices through a vertex
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX`). For the Hermite basis a tangent
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_TANGENT`), normal oriented curves a normal
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL`), and for normal oriented Hermite
curves a normal derivative buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL_DERIVATIVE`)
has to get specified additionally. See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more details on how to set buffers.

The index buffer contains an array of 32-bit indices (`RTC_FORMAT_UINT`
format), each pointing to the first control vertex in the vertex
buffer, but also to the first tangent in the tangent buffer, and first
normal in the normal buffer if these buffers are present.

The vertex buffer stores each control vertex in the form of a single
precision position and radius stored in (`x`, `y`, `z`, `r`) order in
memory (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4` format). The number of vertices is inferred
from the size of this buffer. The radii may be smaller than zero but
the interpolated radii should always be greater or equal to zero.
Similarly, the tangent buffer stores the derivative of each control
vertex (`x`, `y`, `z`, `r` order and `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4` format) and
the normal buffer stores a single precision normal per control vertex
(`x`, `y`, `z` order and `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` format).

##### Linear Basis

For the linear basis the indices point to the first of 2 consecutive
control points in the vertex buffer. The first control point is the
start and the second control point the end of the line segment. When
constructing hair strands in this basis, the end-point can be shared
with the start of the next line segment.

For the linear basis the user optionally can provide a flags buffer of
type `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FLAGS` which contains bytes that encode if the
left neighbor segment (`RTC_CURVE_FLAG_NEIGHBOR_LEFT` flag) and/or
right neighbor segment (`RTC_CURVE_FLAG_NEIGHBOR_RIGHT` flags) exist
(see [RTCCurveFlags]). If this buffer is not set, than the left/right
neighbor bits are automatically calculated base on the index buffer
(left segment exists if segment(id-1)+1 == segment(id) and right
segment exists if segment(id+1)-1 == segment(id)).

A left neighbor segment is assumed to end at the start vertex of the
current segment, and to start at the previous vertex in the vertex
buffer. Similarly, the right neighbor segment is assumed to start at
the end vertex of the current segment, and to end at the next vertex in
the vertex buffer.

Only when the left and right bits are properly specified the current
segment can properly attach to the left and/or right neighbor,
otherwise the touching area may not get rendered properly.

##### Bézier Basis

For the cubic Bézier basis the indices point to the first of 4
consecutive control points in the vertex buffer. These control points
use the cubic Bézier basis, where the first control point represents
the start point of the curve, and the 4th control point the end point
of the curve. The Bézier basis is interpolating, thus the curve does go
exactly through the first and fourth control vertex.

##### B-spline Basis

For the cubic B-spline basis the indices point to the first of 4
consecutive control points in the vertex buffer. These control points
make up a cardinal cubic B-spline (implicit equidistant knot vector).
This basis is not interpolating, thus the curve does in general not go
through any of the control points directly. A big advantage of this
basis is that 3 control points can be shared for two continuous
neighboring curve segments, e.g. the curves (p0,p1,p2,p3) and
(p1,p2,p3,p4) are C1 continuous. This feature makes this basis a good
choice to construct continuous multi-segment curves, as memory
consumption can be kept minimal.

##### Hermite Basis

For the cubic Hermite basis the indices point to the first of 2
consecutive points in the vertex buffer, and the first of 2 consecutive
tangents in the tangent buffer. These two points and two tangents make
up a cubic Hermite curve. This basis is interpolating, thus does
exactly go through the first and second control point, and the first
order derivative at the begin and end matches exactly the value
specified in the tangent buffer. When connecting two segments
continuously, the end point and tangent of the previous segment can be
shared. Different versions of Catmull-Rom splines can be easily
constructed using the Hermite basis, by calculating a proper tangent
buffer from the control points.

##### Catmull-Rom Basis

For the Catmull-Rom basis the indices point to the first of 4
consecutive control points in the vertex buffer. This basis goes
through p1 and p2, with tangents (p2-p0)/2 and (p3-p1)/2.

##### Flat Curves

The `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_FLAT_*` flat mode is a fast mode designed to
render distant hair. In this mode the curve is rendered as a connected
sequence of ray facing quads. Individual quads are considered to have
subpixel size, and zooming onto the curve might show geometric
artifacts. The number of quads to subdivide into can be specified
through the `rtcSetGeometryTessellationRate` function. By default the
tessellation rate is 4.

##### Normal Oriented Curves

The `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_NORMAL_ORIENTED_*` mode is a mode designed to
render blades of grass. In this mode a vertex spline has to get
specified as for the previous modes, but additionally a normal spline
is required. If the Hermite basis is used, the `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL`
and `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL_DERIVATIVE` buffers have both to be set.

The curve is rendered as a flat band whose center approximately follows
the provided vertex spline, whose half width approximately follows the
provided radius spline, and whose normal orientation approximately
follows the provided normal spline.

To intersect the normal oriented curve, we perform a newton-raphson
style intersection of a ray with a tensor product surface of a linear
basis (perpendicular to the curve) and cubic Bézier basis (along the
curve). We use a guide curve and its derivatives to construct the
control points of that surface. The guide curve is defined by a sweep
surface defined by sweeping a line centered at the vertex spline
location along the curve. At each parameter value the half width of the
line matches the radius spline, and the direction matches the cross
product of the normal from the normal spline and tangent of the vertex
spline. Note that this construction does not work when the provided
normals are parallel to the curve direction. For this reason the
provided normals should best be kept as perpendicular to the curve
direction as possible. We further assume second order derivatives of
the center curve to be zero for this construction, as otherwise very
large curvatures occurring in corner cases, can thicken the constructed
curve significantly.

##### Round Curves

In the `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ROUND_*` round mode, a real geometric surface
is rendered for the curve, which is more expensive but allows closeup
views.

For the linear basis the round mode renders a cone that tangentially
touches a start-sphere and end-sphere. The start sphere is rendered
when no previous segments is indicated by the neighbor bits. The end
sphere is always rendered but parts that lie inside the next segment
are clipped away (if that next segment exists). This way a curve is
closed on both ends and the interior will render properly as long as
only neighboring segments penetrate into a segment. For this to work
properly it is important that the flags buffer is properly populated
with neighbor information.

For the cubic polynomial bases, the round mode renders a sweep surface
by sweeping a varying radius circle tangential along the curve. As a
limitation, the radius of the curve has to be smaller than the
curvature radius of the curve at each location on the curve.

The intersection with the curve segment stores the parametric hit
location along the curve segment as u-coordinate (range 0 to +1).

For flat curves, the v-coordinate is set to the normalized distance in
the range -1 to +1. For normal oriented curves the v-coordinate is in
the range 0 to 1. For the linear basis and in round mode the
v-coordinate is set to zero.

In flat mode, the geometry normal `Ng` is set to the tangent of the
curve at the hit location. In round mode and for normal oriented
curves, the geometry normal `Ng` is set to the non-normalized geometric
normal of the surface.

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers must have the same stride and size. For the Hermite
basis also a tangent buffer has to be set for each time step and for
normal oriented curves a normal buffer has to get specified for each
time step.

Also see tutorials [Hair] and [Curves] for examples of how to
create and use curve geometries.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_POINT
--------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT -
      point geometry spheres

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT -
      point geometry with ray-oriented discs

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT -
      point geometry with normal-oriented discs

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT);
    rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT);
    rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Points with per vertex radii are supported with sphere, ray-oriented
discs, and normal-oriented discs geometric representations. Such point
geometries are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT`,
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT`, or
`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT` to the `rtcNewGeometry`
function. The point vertices can be specified t through a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX`). For the normal oriented discs a normal
buffer (`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL`) has to get specified additionally.
See `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` and `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` for more
details on how to set buffers.

The vertex buffer stores each control vertex in the form of a single
precision position and radius stored in (`x`, `y`, `z`, `r`) order in
memory (`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4` format). The number of vertices is inferred
from the size of this buffer. Similarly, the normal buffer stores a
single precision normal per control vertex (`x`, `y`, `z` order and
`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` format).

In the `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SPHERE_POINT` mode, a real geometric surface
is rendered for the curve, which is more expensive but allows closeup
views.

The `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_DISC_POINT` flat mode is a fast mode designed to
render distant points. In this mode the point is rendered as a ray
facing disc.

The `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_ORIENTED_DISC_POINT` mode is a mode designed as
a midpoint geometrically between ray facing discs and spheres. In this
mode the point is rendered as a normal oriented disc.

For all point types, only the hit distance and geometry normal is
returned as hit information, u and v are set to zero.

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` call. Then a vertex
buffer for each time step can be set using different buffer slots, and
all these buffers must have the same stride and size.

Also see tutorial [Points] for an example of how to create and use
point geometries.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_USER
-------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER - user geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
      rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

User-defined geometries contain a number of user-defined primitives,
just like triangle meshes contain multiple triangles. The shape of the
user-defined primitives is specified through registered callback
functions, which enable extending Embree with arbitrary types of
primitives.

User-defined geometries are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER`
to the `rtcNewGeometry` function call. One has to set the number of
primitives (see `rtcSetGeometryUserPrimitiveCount`), a user data
pointer (see `rtcSetGeometryUserData`), a bounding function closure
(see `rtcSetGeometryBoundsFunction`), as well as user-defined intersect
(see `rtcSetGeometryIntersectFunction`) and occluded (see
`rtcSetGeometryOccludedFunction`) callback functions. The bounding
function is used to query the bounds of all time steps of a user
primitive, while the intersect and occluded callback functions are
called to intersect the primitive with a ray. The user data pointer is
passed to each callback invocation and can be used to point to the
application's representation of the user geometry.

The creation of a user geometry typically looks the following:

    RTCGeometry geometry = rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_USER);
    rtcSetGeometryUserPrimitiveCount(geometry, numPrimitives);
    rtcSetGeometryUserData(geometry, userGeometryRepresentation);
    rtcSetGeometryBoundsFunction(geometry, boundsFunction);
    rtcSetGeometryIntersectFunction(geometry, intersectFunction);
    rtcSetGeometryOccludedFunction(geometry, occludedFunction);

Please have a look at the `rtcSetGeometryBoundsFunction`,
`rtcSetGeometryIntersectFunction`, and `rtcSetGeometryOccludedFunction`
functions on the implementation of the callback functions.

Primitives of a user geometry are ignored during rendering when their
bounds are empty, thus bounds have lower\>upper in at least one
dimension.

See tutorial [User Geometry] for an example of how to use the
user-defined geometries.

RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_INSTANCE
-----------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE - instance geometry type

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCGeometry geometry =
       rtcNewGeometry(device, RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Embree supports instancing of scenes using affine transformations (3×3
matrix plus translation). As the instanced scene is stored only a
single time, even if instanced to multiple locations, this feature can
be used to create very complex scenes with small memory footprint.

Embree supports both single-level instancing and multi-level
instancing. The maximum instance nesting depth is
`RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT`; it can be configured at compile-time
using the constant `EMBREE_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT`. Users should
adapt this constant to their needs: instances nested any deeper are
silently ignored in release mode, and cause assertions in debug mode.

Instances are created by passing `RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE` to the
`rtcNewGeometry` function call. The instanced scene can be set using
the `rtcSetGeometryInstancedScene` call, and the affine transformation
can be set using the `rtcSetGeometryTransform` function.

Please note that `rtcCommitScene` on the instanced scene should be
called first, followed by `rtcCommitGeometry` on the instance, followed
by `rtcCommitScene` for the top-level scene containing the instance.

If a ray hits the instance, the `geomID` and `primID` members of the
hit are set to the geometry ID and primitive ID of the hit primitive in
the instanced scene, and the `instID` member of the hit is set to the
geometry ID of the instance in the top-level scene.

The instancing scheme can also be implemented using user geometries. To
achieve this, the user geometry code should set the `instID` member of
the intersection context to the geometry ID of the instance, then trace
the transformed ray, and finally set the `instID` field of the
intersection context again to -1. The `instID` field is copied
automatically by each primitive intersector into the `instID` field of
the hit structure when the primitive is hit. See the [User Geometry]
tutorial for an example.

For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` function. Then a
transformation for each time step can be specified using the
`rtcSetGeometryTransform` function.

See tutorials [Instanced Geometry] and [Multi Level Instancing] for
examples of how to use instances.

RTCCurveFlags
-------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTCCurveFlags - per segment flags for curve geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

enum RTCCurveFlags { RTC\_CURVE\_FLAG\_NEIGHBOR\_LEFT = (1 \<\< 0),
RTC\_CURVE\_FLAG\_NEIGHBOR\_RIGHT = (1 \<\< 1) };

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The RTCCurveFlags type is used for linear curves to determine if the
left and/or right neighbor segment exist. Therefore one attaches a
buffer of type RTC\_BUFFER\_TYPE\_FLAGS to the curve geometry which
stores an individual byte per curve segment.

If the RTC\_CURVE\_FLAG\_NEIGHBOR\_LEFT flag in that byte is enabled
for a curve segment, then the left segment exists (which starts one
vertex before the start vertex of the current curve) and the current
segment is rendered to properly attach to that segment.

If the RTC\_CURVE\_FLAG\_NEIGHBOR\_RIGHT flag in that byte is enabled
for a curve segment, then the right segment exists (which ends one
vertex after the end vertex of the current curve) and the current
segment is rendered to properly attach to that segment.

When not properly specifying left and right flags for linear curves,
the rendering at the ending of these curves may not look correct, in
particular when round linear curves are viewed from the inside.

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcRetainGeometry(RTCGeometry geometry);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Geometry objects are reference counted. The `rtcRetainGeometry`
function increments the reference count of the passed geometry object
(`geometry` argument). This function together with `rtcReleaseGeometry`
allows to use the internal reference counting in a C++ wrapper class to
handle the ownership of the object.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Geometry objects are reference counted. The `rtcReleaseGeometry`
function decrements the reference count of the passed geometry object
(`geometry` argument). When the reference count falls to 0, the
geometry gets destroyed.

    rtcCommitGeometry - commits geometry changes

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    void rtcCommitGeometry(RTCGeometry geometry);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcCommitGeometry` function is used to commit all geometry changes
performed to a geometry (`geometry` parameter). After a geometry gets
modified, this function must be called to properly update the internal
state of the geometry to perform interpolations using `rtcInterpolate`
or to commit a scene containing the geometry using `rtcCommitScene`.

    void rtcEnableGeometry(RTCGeometry geometry);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcEnableGeometry` function enables the specified geometry
(`geometry` argument). Only enabled geometries are rendered. Each
geometry is enabled by default at construction time.

After enabling a geometry, the scene containing that geometry must be
committed using `rtcCommitScene` for the change to have effect.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcDisableGeometry` function disables the specified geometry
(`geometry` argument). A disabled geometry is not rendered. Each
geometry is enabled by default at construction time.

After disabling a geometry, the scene containing that geometry must be

rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount
---------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount - sets the number of time steps of the

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      unsigned int timeStepCount
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` function sets the number of time
steps for multi-segment motion blur (`timeStepCount` parameter) of the
specified geometry (`geometry` parameter).

For triangle meshes (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE`), quad meshes
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD`), curves (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_CURVE`), points
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_POINT`), and subdivision geometries
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION`), the number of time steps directly
corresponds to the number of vertex buffer slots available
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` buffer type). For these geometries, one
vertex buffer per time step must be specified when creating
multi-segment motion blur geometries.

For instance geometries (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_INSTANCE`), a
transformation must be specified for each time step (see
`rtcSetGeometryTransform`).

For user geometries, the registered bounding callback function must
provide a bounding box per primitive and time step, and the
intersection and occlusion callback functions should properly intersect
the motion-blurred geometry at the ray time.

rtcSetGeometryTimeRange
-----------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryTimeRange - sets the time range for a motion blur geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryTimeRange(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      float startTime,
      float endTime
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryTimeRange` function sets a time range which defines
the start (and end time) of the first (and last) time step of a motion
blur geometry. The time range is defined relative to the camera shutter
interval [0,1] but it can be arbitrary. Thus the startTime can be
smaller, equal, or larger 0, indicating a geometry whose animation
definition start before, at, or after the camera shutter opens. Similar
the endTime can be smaller, equal, or larger than 1, indicating a
geometry whose animation definition ends after, at, or before the
camera shutter closes. The startTime has to be smaller or equal to the
endTime.

The default time range when this function is not called is the entire
camera shutter [0,1]. For best performance at most one time segment
of the piece wise linear definition of the motion should fall outside
the shutter window to the left and to the right. Thus do not set the
startTime or endTime too far outside the [0,1] interval for best
performance.

This time range feature will also allow geometries to appear and
disappear during the camera shutter time if the specified time range is
a sub range of [0,1].

Please also have a look at the `rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount` function
to see how to define the time steps for the specified time range.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeCount` function sets the number of
slots (`vertexAttributeCount` parameter) for vertex attribute buffers
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE`) that can be used for the specified
geometry (`geometry` parameter).

This function is supported only for triangle meshes
(`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_TRIANGLE`), quad meshes (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_QUAD`),
curves (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_CURVE`), points (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_POINT`),
and subdivision geometries (`RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION`).

rtcSetGeometryMask
------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryMask - sets the geometry mask

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryMask(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      unsigned int mask
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryMask` function sets a 32-bit geometry mask (`mask`
argument) for the specified geometry (`geometry` argument).

This geometry mask is used together with the ray mask stored inside the
`mask` field of the ray. The primitives of the geometry are hit by the
ray only if the bitwise `and` operation of the geometry mask with the
ray mask is not 0. This feature can be used to disable selected
geometries for specifically tagged rays, e.g. to disable shadow casting
for certain geometries.

Ray masks are disabled in Embree by default at compile time, and can be
enabled through the `EMBREE_RAY_MASK` parameter in CMake. One can query
whether ray masks are enabled by querying the
`RTC_DEVICE_PROPERTY_RAY_MASK_SUPPORTED` device property using
`rtcGetDeviceProperty`.

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryBuildQuality(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      enum RTCBuildQuality quality
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryBuildQuality` function sets the build quality
(`quality` argument) for the specified geometry (`geometry` argument).
The per-geometry build quality is only a hint and may be ignored.
Embree currently uses the per-geometry build quality when the scene
build quality is set to `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_LOW`. In this mode a
two-level acceleration structure is build, and geometries build a
separate acceleration structure using the geometry build quality. The
per-geometry build quality can be one of:

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_LOW`: Creates lower quality data structures,
    e.g. for dynamic scenes.

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_MEDIUM`: Default build quality for most usages.
    Gives a good compromise between build and render performance.

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_HIGH`: Creates higher quality data structures
    for final-frame rendering. Enables a spatial split builder for
    certain primitive types.

-   `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_REFIT`: Uses a BVH refitting approach when
    changing only the vertex buffer.

rtcSetGeometryBuffer
--------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryBuffer - assigns a view of a buffer to the geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

      RTCBuffer buffer,
      size_t byteOffset,
      size_t byteStride,

    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryBuffer` function binds a view of a buffer object
(`buffer` argument) to a geometry buffer type and slot (`type` and
`slot` argument) of the specified geometry (`geometry` argument).

One can specify the start of the first buffer element in bytes
(`byteOffset` argument), the byte stride between individual buffer
elements (`byteStride` argument), the format of the buffer elements
(`format` argument), and the number of elements to bind (`itemCount`).

The start address (`byteOffset` argument) and stride (`byteStride`
argument) must be both aligned to 4 bytes, otherwise the
`rtcSetGeometryBuffer` function will fail.

After successful completion of this function, the geometry will hold a
reference to the buffer object.

rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer

#### NAME {#name}

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      enum RTCBufferType type,
      unsigned int slot,
      enum RTCFormat format,
      const void* ptr,
      size_t byteOffset,
      size_t byteStride,
      size_t itemCount
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` function binds a view of a shared
user-managed data buffer (`ptr` argument) to a geometry buffer type and
slot (`type` and `slot` argument) of the specified geometry (`geometry`
argument).

One can specify the start of the first buffer element in bytes
(`byteOffset` argument), the byte stride between individual buffer
elements (`byteStride` argument), the format of the buffer elements
(`format` argument), and the number of elements to bind (`itemCount`).

The start address (`byteOffset` argument) and stride (`byteStride`
argument) must be both aligned to 4 bytes; otherwise the
`rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer` function will fail.

When the buffer will be used as a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` and `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE`), the
last buffer element must be readable using 16-byte SSE load
instructions, thus padding the last element is required for certain
layouts. E.g. a standard `float3` vertex buffer layout should add
storage for at least one more float to the end of the buffer.

The buffer data must remain valid for as long as the buffer may be
used, and the user is responsible for freeing the buffer data when no
longer required.

Sharing buffers can significantly reduce the memory required by the
application, thus we recommend using this feature. When enabling the
`RTC_SCENE_FLAG_COMPACT` scene flag, the spatial index structures index
into the vertex buffer, resulting in even higher memory savings.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetNewGeometryBuffer` function creates a new data buffer of
specified format (`format` argument), byte stride (`byteStride`
argument), and number of items (`itemCount` argument), and assigns it
to a geometry buffer slot (`type` and `slot` argument) of the specified
geometry (`geometry` argument). The buffer data is managed internally
and automatically freed when the geometry is destroyed.

The byte stride (`byteStride` argument) must be aligned to 4 bytes;
otherwise the `rtcSetNewGeometryBuffer` function will fail.

The allocated buffer will be automatically over-allocated slightly when
used as a vertex buffer, where a requirement is that each buffer
element should be readable using 16-byte SSE load instructions.

};

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `RTFormat` structure defines the data format stored in data buffers
provided to Embree using the [rtcSetGeometryBuffer],
[rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer], and [rtcSetNewGeometryBuffer] API
calls.

The `RTC_FORMAT_UINT/2/3/4` format are used to specify that data
buffers store unsigned integers, or unsigned integer vectors of size
2,3 or 4. This format has typically to get used when specifying index
buffers, e.g. `RTC_FORMAT_UINT3` for triangle meshes.

The `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT/2/3/4...` format are used to specify that data
buffers store single precision floating point values, or vectors there
of (size 2,3,4, etc.). This format is typcally used to specify to
format of vertex buffers, e.g. the `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3` type for vertex
buffers of triangle meshes.

The `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3X4_ROW_MAJOR` and
`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3X4_COLUMN_MAJOR` formats, specify a 3x4 floating
point matrix layed out either row major or column major. The
`RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4X4_ROW_MAJOR` and `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4X4_COLUMN_MAJOR`
formats, specify a 4x4 floating point matrix layed out either row major
or column major. These matrix formats are used in the
[rtcSetGeometryTransform] function in order to set a transformation
matrix for geometries.

The `RTC_FORMAT_GRID` is a special data format used to specify grid
primitives of layout RTCGrid when creating grid geometries (see
[RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_GRID]).

      RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_HOLE                 = 22,

      RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FLAGS = 32
    };

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `RTBufferType` structure defines slots to assign data buffers to
using the [rtcSetGeometryBuffer], [rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer], and
[rtcSetNewGeometryBuffer] API calls.

For most geometry types the `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX` slot is used to
assign an index buffer, while the `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` is used to
assign the corresponding vertex buffer.

The `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE` slot can get used to assign
arbitrary additional vertex data which can get interpolated using the
[rtcInterpolate] API call.

The `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL`, `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_TANGENT`, and
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_NORMAL_DERIVATIVE` are special buffers required to
assign per vertex normals, tangents, and normal derivatives for some
curve types.

The `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_GRID` buffer is used to assign the grid primitive
buffer for grid geometries (see [RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_GRID]).

The `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FACE`, `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_LEVEL`,
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_INDEX`,
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_WEIGHT`,
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_INDEX`,
`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_WEIGHT`, and `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_HOLE` are
special buffers required to create subdivision meshes (see
[RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_SUBDIVISION]).

The `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FLAGS` can get used to add additional flag per
primitive of a geometry, and is currently only used for linear curves.

    void rtcUpdateGeometryBuffer(
      RTCGeometry geometry,

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcUpdateGeometryBuffer` function marks the buffer view bound to
the specified buffer type and slot (`type` and `slot` argument) of a
geometry (`geometry` argument) as modified.

If a data buffer is changed by the application, the
`rtcUpdateGeometryBuffer` call must be invoked for that buffer. Each
buffer view assigned to a buffer slot is initially marked as modified,
thus this function needs to be called only when doing buffer
modifications after the first `rtcCommitScene`.

rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction
-------------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction - sets the intersection filter
      for the geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    struct RTCFilterFunctionNArguments
    {
      int* valid;
      void* geometryUserPtr;
      const struct RTCIntersectContext* context;
      struct RTCRayN* ray;
      struct RTCHitN* hit;
      unsigned int N;
    };

    typedef void (*RTCFilterFunctionN)(
      const struct RTCFilterFunctionNArguments* args
    );

    void rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      RTCFilterFunctionN filter
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction` function registers an
intersection filter callback function (`filter` argument) for the
specified geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered intersection filter function is invoked for every hit
encountered during the `rtcIntersect`-type ray queries and can accept
or reject that hit. The feature can be used to define a silhouette for
a primitive and reject hits that are outside the silhouette. E.g. a
tree leaf could be modeled with an alpha texture that decides whether
hit points lie inside or outside the leaf.

If the `RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_HIGH` mode is set, the filter functions may
be called multiple times for the same primitive hit. Further, rays
hitting exactly the edge might also report two hits for the same
surface. For certain use cases, the application may have to work around
this limitation by collecting already reported hits (`geomID`/`primID`
pairs) and ignoring duplicates.

The filter function callback of type `RTCFilterFunctionN` gets passed a
number of arguments through the `RTCFilterFunctionNArguments`
structure. The `valid` parameter of that structure points to an integer
valid mask (0 means invalid and -1 means valid). The `geometryUserPtr`
member is a user pointer optionally set per geometry through the
`rtcSetGeometryUserData` function. The `context` member points to the
intersection context passed to the ray query function. The `ray`
parameter points to `N` rays in SOA layout. The `hit` parameter points
to `N` hits in SOA layout to test. The `N` parameter is the number of
rays and hits in `ray` and `hit`. The hit distance is provided as the
`tfar` value of the ray. If the hit geometry is instanced, the `instID`
member of the ray is valid, and the ray and the potential hit are in
object space.

The filter callback function has the task to check for each valid ray
whether it wants to accept or reject the corresponding hit. To reject a
hit, the filter callback function just has to write `0` to the integer
valid mask of the corresponding ray. To accept the hit, it just has to
leave the valid mask set to `-1`. The filter function is further
allowed to change the hit and decrease the `tfar` value of the ray but
it should not modify other ray data nor any inactive components of the
ray or hit.

When performing ray queries using `rtcIntersect1`, it is guaranteed
that the packet size is 1 when the callback is invoked. When performing
ray queries using the `rtcIntersect4/8/16` functions, it is not
generally guaranteed that the ray packet size (and order of rays inside
the packet) passed to the callback matches the initial ray packet.
However, under some circumstances these properties are guaranteed, and
whether this is the case can be queried using `rtcGetDeviceProperty`.
When performing ray queries using the stream API such as
`rtcIntersect1M`, `rtcIntersect1Mp`, `rtcIntersectNM`, or
`rtcIntersectNp` the order of rays and ray packet size of the callback
function might change to either 1, 4, 8, or 16.

For many usage scenarios, repacking and re-ordering of rays does not
cause difficulties in implementing the callback function. However,
algorithms that need to extend the ray with additional data must use
the `rayID` component of the ray to identify the original ray to access
the per-ray data.

The implementation of the filter function can choose to implement a
single code path that uses the ray access helper functions `RTCRay_XXX`
and hit access helper functions `RTCHit_XXX` to access ray and hit
data. Alternatively the code can branch to optimized implementations
for specific sizes of `N` and cast the `ray` and `hit` inputs to the
proper packet types.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryOccludedFilterFunction` function registers an
occlusion filter callback function (`filter` argument) for the
specified geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered intersection filter function is invoked for every hit
encountered during the `rtcOccluded`-type ray queries and can accept or
reject that hit. The feature can be used to define a silhouette for a
primitive and reject hits that are outside the silhouette. E.g. a tree
leaf could be modeled with an alpha texture that decides whether hit
points lie inside or outside the leaf.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcFilterIntersection` function can be called inside an

filter registered to the geometry and stored inside the context. For
this an `RTCFilterFunctionNArguments` structure must be created (see
`rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction`) which basically consists of a
valid mask, a hit packet to filter, the corresponding ray packet, and
the packet size. After the invocation of `rtcFilterIntersection`, only
rays that are still valid (valid mask set to -1) should update a hit.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryUserData` function sets the user-defined data
pointer (`userPtr` argument) for a geometry (`geometry` argument). This
user data pointer is intended to be pointing to the application's
representation of the geometry, and is passed to various callback
functions. The application can use this pointer inside the callback
functions to access its geometry representation.

The `rtcGetGeometryUserData` function can be used to query an already

    );

    void rtcSetGeometryBoundsFunction(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      RTCBoundsFunction bounds,
      void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryBoundsFunction` function registers a bounding box
callback function (`bounds` argument) with payload (`userPtr` argument)
for the specified user geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered bounding box callback function is invoked to calculate
axis-aligned bounding boxes of the primitives of the user-defined
geometry during spatial acceleration structure construction. The
bounding box callback of `RTCBoundsFunction` type is invoked with a
pointer to a structure of type `RTCBoundsFunctionArguments` which
contains various arguments, such as: the user data of the geometry
(`geometryUserPtr` member), the ID of the primitive to calculate the
bounds for (`primID` member), the time step at which to calculate the
bounds (`timeStep` member), and a memory location to write the
calculated bound to (`bounds_o` member).

In a typical usage scenario one would store a pointer to the internal
representation of the user geometry object using
`rtcSetGeometryUserData`. The callback function can then read that
pointer from the `geometryUserPtr` field and calculate the proper
bounding box for the requested primitive and time, and store that
bounding box to the destination structure (`bounds_o` member).

      const struct RTCIntersectFunctionNArguments* args
    );

    void rtcSetGeometryIntersectFunction(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      RTCIntersectFunctionN intersect
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryIntersectFunction` function registers a
ray/primitive intersection callback function (`intersect` argument) for
the specified user geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered callback function is invoked by `rtcIntersect`-type ray
queries to calculate the intersection of a ray packet of variable size
with one user-defined primitive. The callback function of type
`RTCIntersectFunctionN` gets passed a number of arguments through the
`RTCIntersectFunctionNArguments` structure. The value `N` specifies the
ray packet size, `valid` points to an array of integers that specify
whether the corresponding ray is valid (-1) or invalid (0), the
`geometryUserPtr` member points to the geometry user data previously
set through `rtcSetGeometryUserData`, the `context` member points to
the intersection context passed to the ray query, the `rayhit` member
points to a ray and hit packet of variable size `N`, and the `geomID`
and `primID` member identifies the geometry ID and primitive ID of the
primitive to intersect.

The `ray` component of the `rayhit` structure contains valid data, in
particular the `tfar` value is the current closest hit distance found.
All data inside the `hit` component of the `rayhit` structure are
undefined and should not be read by the function.

The task of the callback function is to intersect each active ray from
the ray packet with the specified user primitive. If the user-defined
primitive is missed by a ray of the ray packet, the function should
return without modifying the ray or hit. If an intersection of the
user-defined primitive with the ray was found in the valid range (from
`tnear` to `tfar`), it should update the hit distance of the ray
(`tfar` member) and the hit (`u`, `v`, `Ng`, `instID`, `geomID`,
`primID` members). In particular, the currently intersected instance is
stored in the `instID` field of the intersection context, which must be
deep copied into the `instID` member of the hit.

As a primitive might have multiple intersections with a ray, the
intersection filter function needs to be invoked by the user geometry
intersection callback for each encountered intersection, if filtering
of intersections is desired. This can be achieved through the
`rtcFilterIntersection` call.

Within the user geometry intersect function, it is safe to trace new
rays and create new scenes and geometries.

When performing ray queries using `rtcIntersect1`, it is guaranteed
that the packet size is 1 when the callback is invoked. When performing
ray queries using the `rtcIntersect4/8/16` functions, it is not
generally guaranteed that the ray packet size (and order of rays inside
the packet) passed to the callback matches the initial ray packet.
However, under some circumstances these properties are guaranteed, and
whether this is the case can be queried using `rtcGetDeviceProperty`.

cause difficulties in implementing the callback function. However,
algorithms that need to extend the ray with additional data must use
the `rayID` component of the ray to identify the original ray to access
the per-ray data.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryOccludedFunction` function registers a ray/primitive
occlusion callback function (`filter` argument) for the specified user
geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered callback function is invoked by `rtcOccluded`-type ray
queries to test whether the rays of a packet of variable size are
occluded by a user-defined primitive. The callback function of type
`RTCOccludedFunctionN` gets passed a number of arguments through the
`RTCOccludedFunctionNArguments` structure. The value `N` specifies the
ray packet size, `valid` points to an array of integers which specify
whether the corresponding ray is valid (-1) or invalid (0), the
`geometryUserPtr` member points to the geometry user data previously
set through `rtcSetGeometryUserData`, the `context` member points to
the intersection context passed to the ray query, the `ray` member
points to a ray packet of variable size `N`, and the `geomID` and
`primID` member identifies the geometry ID and primitive ID of the
primitive to intersect.

The task of the callback function is to intersect each active ray from
the ray packet with the specified user primitive. If the user-defined
primitive is missed by a ray of the ray packet, the function should
return without modifying the ray. If an intersection of the
user-defined primitive with the ray was found in the valid range (from
`tnear` to `tfar`), it should set the `tfar` member of the ray to
`-inf`.

As a primitive might have multiple intersections with a ray, the
occlusion filter function needs to be invoked by the user geometry
occlusion callback for each encountered intersection, if filtering of
intersections is desired. This can be achieved through the
`rtcFilterOcclusion` call.

Within the user geometry occlusion function, it is safe to trace new
rays and create new scenes and geometries.

When performing ray queries using `rtcOccluded1`, it is guaranteed that
the packet size is 1 when the callback is invoked. When performing ray
queries using the `rtcOccluded4/8/16` functions, it is not generally
guaranteed that the ray packet size (and order of rays inside the
packet) passed to the callback matches the initial ray packet. However,
under some circumstances these properties are guaranteed, and whether
this is the case can be queried using `rtcGetDeviceProperty`. When
performing ray queries using the stream API such as `rtcOccluded1M`,
`rtcOccluded1Mp`, `rtcOccludedNM`, or `rtcOccludedNp` the order of rays
and ray packet size of the callback function might change to either 1,
4, 8, or 16.

For many usage scenarios, repacking and re-ordering of rays does not
cause difficulties in implementing the callback function. However,
algorithms that need to extend the ray with additional data must use
the `rayID` component of the ray to identify the original ray to access
the per-ray data.

rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction
--------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction - sets the point query callback function
      for a geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    struct RTCPointQueryFunctionArguments
    {
      // the (world space) query object that was passed as an argument of rtcPointQuery.
      struct RTCPointQuery* query;

      // used for user input/output data. Will not be read or modified internally.
      void* userPtr;

      // primitive and geometry ID of primitive
      unsigned int  primID;        
      unsigned int  geomID;    

      // the context with transformation and instance ID stack
      struct RTCPointQueryContext* context;

      // scaling factor indicating whether the current instance transformation
      // is a similarity transformation.
      float similarityScale;
    };

    typedef bool (*RTCPointQueryFunction)(
      struct RTCPointQueryFunctionArguments* args
    );

    void rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      RTCPointQueryFunction queryFunc
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction` function registers a point query
callback function (`queryFunc` argument) for the specified geometry
(`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered callback function is invoked by [rtcPointQuery] for
every primitive of the geometry that intersects the corresponding point
query domain. The callback function of type `RTCPointQueryFunction`
gets passed a number of arguments through the
`RTCPointQueryFunctionArguments` structure. The `query` object is the
original point query object passed into [rtcPointQuery], `usrPtr` is
an arbitrary pointer to pass input into and store results of the
callback function. The `primID`, `geomID` and `context` (see
[rtcInitPointQueryContext] for details) can be used to identify the
geometry data of the primitive.

A `RTCPointQueryFunction` can also be passed directly as an argument to
[rtcPointQuery]. In this case the callback is invoked for all
primitives in the scene that intersect the query domain. If a callback
function is passed as an argument to [rtcPointQuery] and (a
potentially different) callback function is set for a geometry with
[rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction] both callback functions are
invoked and the callback function passed to [rtcPointQuery] will be
called before the geometry specific callback function.

If instancing is used, the parameter `simliarityScale` indicates
whether the current instance transform (top element of the stack in
`context`) is a similarity transformation or not. Similarity
transformations are composed of translation, rotation and uniform
scaling and if a matrix M defines a similarity transformation, there is
a scaling factor D such that for all x,y: dist(Mx, My) = D \* dist(x,
y). In this case the parameter `scalingFactor` is this scaling factor D
and otherwise it is 0. A valid similarity scale (`similarityScale` \>
0) allows to compute distance information in instance space and scale
the distances into world space (for example, to update the query
radius, see below) by dividing the instance space distance with the
similarity scale. If the current instance transform is not a similarity
transform (`similarityScale` is 0), the distance computation has to be
performed in world space to ensure correctness. In this case the
instance to world transformations given with the `context` should be
used to transform the primitive data into world space. Otherwise, the
query location can be transformed into instance space which can be more
efficient. If there is no instance transform, the similarity scale is
1.

The callback function will potentially be called for primitives outside
the query domain for two reasons: First, the callback is invoked for
all primitives inside a BVH leaf node since no geometry data of
primitives is determined internally and therefore individual primitives
are not culled (only their (aggregated) bounding boxes). Second, in
case non similarity transformations are used, the resulting ellipsoidal
query domain (in instance space) is approximated by its axis aligned
bounding box internally and therefore inner nodes that do not intersect
the original domain might intersect the approximative bounding box
which results in unnecessary callbacks. In any case, the callbacks are
conservative, i.e. if a primitive is inside the query domain a callback
will be invoked but the reverse is not necessarily true.

For efficiency, the radius of the `query` object can be decreased (in
world space) inside the callback function to improve culling of
geometry during BVH traversal. If the query radius was updated, the
callback function should return `true` to issue an update of internal
traversal information. Increasing the radius or modifying the time or
position of the query results in undefined behaviour.

Within the callback function, it is safe to call [rtcPointQuery]
again, for example when implementing instancing manually. In this case
the instance transformation should be pushed onto the stack in
`context`. Embree will internally compute the point query information
in instance space using the top element of the stack in `context` when
[rtcPointQuery] is called.

For a reference implementation of a closest point traversal of triangle
meshes using instancing and user defined instancing see the tutorial
[ClosestPoint].

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryTransform` function sets the local-to-world affine
transformation (`xfm` parameter) of an instance geometry (`geometry`
parameter) for a particular time step (`timeStep` parameter). The
transformation is specified as a 3×4 matrix (3×3 linear transformation
plus translation), for which the following formats (`format` parameter)
are supported:

    out in column-major form.

-   `RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT4X4_COLUMN_MAJOR`: The 3×4 float matrix is laid
    out in column-major form as a 4×4 homogeneous matrix with the last
    row being equal to (0, 0, 0, 1).

rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion
---------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion - sets the transformation for a particular

      transformation matrix using quaternions to represent the rotation.

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      unsigned int timeStep,
      const struct RTCQuaternionDecomposition* qd
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion` function sets the
local-to-world affine transformation (`qd` parameter) of an instance
geometry (`geometry` parameter) for a particular time step (`timeStep`
parameter). The transformation is specified as a
[RTCQuaternionDecomposition], which is a decomposition of an affine
transformation that represents the rotational component of an affine
transformation as a quaternion. This allows interpolating rotational
transformations exactly using spherical linear interpolation (such as a
turning wheel).

For more information about the decomposition see
[RTCQuaternionDecomposition]. The quaternion given in the
`RTCQuaternionDecomposition` struct will be normalized internally.

For correct results, the transformation matrices for all time steps
must be set either using `rtcSetGeometryTransform` or
`rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion`. Mixing both representations is not
allowed. Spherical linear interpolation will be used, iff the
transformation matizes are set with
`rtcSetGeometryTransformQuaternion`.

For an example of this feature see the tutorial [Quaternion Motion
Blur].

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryTopologyCount` function sets the number of
topologies (`topologyCount` parameter) for the specified subdivision
geometry (`geometry` parameter). The number of topologies of a
subdivision geometry must be greater or equal to 1.

To use multiple topologies, first the number of topologies must be

    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode` function sets the subdivision mode
(`mode` parameter) for the topology (`topologyID` parameter) of the
specified subdivision geometry (`geometry` parameter).

The subdivision modes can be used to force linear interpolation for
certain parts of the subdivision mesh:

-   `RTC_SUBDIVISION_MODE_NO_BOUNDARY`: Boundary patches are ignored.
    This way each rendered patch has a full set of control vertices.

-   `RTC_SUBDIVISION_MODE_SMOOTH_BOUNDARY`: The sequence of boundary
    control points are used to generate a smooth B-spline boundary
    curve (default mode).

-   `RTC_SUBDIVISION_MODE_PIN_CORNERS`: Corner vertices are pinned to
    their location during subdivision.

-   `RTC_SUBDIVISION_MODE_PIN_BOUNDARY`: All vertices at the border are
    pinned to their location during subdivision. This way the boundary
    is interpolated linearly. This mode is typically used for texturing
    to also map texels at the border of the texture to the mesh.

-   `RTC_SUBDIVISION_MODE_PIN_ALL`: All vertices at the border are
    pinned to their location during subdivision. This way all patches
    are linearly interpolated.

rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology
-------------------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology - binds a vertex
      attribute to a topology of the geometry

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      unsigned int vertexAttributeID,
      unsigned int topologyID
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology` function binds a vertex
attribute buffer slot (`vertexAttributeID` argument) to a topology
(`topologyID` argument) for the specified subdivision geometry
(`geometry` argument). Standard vertex buffers are always bound to the
default topology (topology 0) and cannot be bound differently. A vertex
attribute buffer always uses the topology it is bound to when used in
the `rtcInterpolate` and `rtcInterpolateN` calls.

A topology with ID `i` consists of a subdivision mode set through
`rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode` and the index buffer bound to the index
buffer slot `i`. This index buffer can assign indices for each face of
the subdivision geometry that are different to the indices of the
default topology. These new indices can for example be used to
introduce additional borders into the subdivision mesh to map multiple
textures onto one subdivision geometry.

    {
      void* geometryUserPtr;

    };

    typedef void (*RTCDisplacementFunctionN)(
       const struct RTCDisplacementFunctionNArguments* args
    );

    void rtcSetGeometryDisplacementFunction(
      RTCGeometry geometry,
      RTCDisplacementFunctionN displacement
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcSetGeometryDisplacementFunction` function registers a
displacement callback function (`displacement` argument) for the
specified subdivision geometry (`geometry` argument).

Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing `NULL` as function pointer disables the registered callback
function.

The registered displacement callback function is invoked to displace
points on the subdivision geometry during spatial acceleration
structure construction, during the `rtcCommitScene` call.

The callback function of type `RTCDisplacementFunctionN` is invoked
with a number of arguments stored inside the
`RTCDisplacementFunctionNArguments` structure. The provided user data
pointer of the geometry (`geometryUserPtr` member) can be used to point
to the application's representation of the subdivision mesh. A number
`N` of points to displace are specified in a structure of array layout.
For each point to displace, the local patch UV coordinates (`u` and `v`
arrays), the normalized geometry normal (`Ng_x`, `Ng_y`, and `Ng_z`
arrays), and the position (`P_x`, `P_y`, and `P_z` arrays) are
provided. The task of the displacement function is to use this
information and change the position data.

The geometry handle (`geometry` member) and primitive ID (`primID`
member) of the patch to displace are additionally provided as well as
the time step `timeStep`, which can be important if the displacement is
time-dependent and motion blur is used.

All passed arrays must be aligned to 64 bytes and properly padded to
make wide vector processing inside the displacement function easily
possible.

Also see tutorial [Displacement Geometry] for an example of how to
use the displacement mapping functions.

half edge belonging to the specified face (`faceID` argument). For
instance in the following example the first half edge of face `f1` is
`e4`.

![][imgHalfEdges]

This function can only be used for subdivision geometries. As all
topologies of a subdivision geometry share the same face buffer the
function does not depend on the topology ID.

Here f0 to f7 are 8 quadrilateral faces with 4 vertices each. The edges
e0 to e23 of these faces are shown with their orientation. For each
face the ID of the edges corresponds to the slots the face occupies in
the index array of the geometry. E.g. as the indices of face f1 start
at location 4 of the index array, the first edge is edge e4, the next
edge e5, etc.

opposite half edge of the specified half edge (`edgeID` argument) in
the specified topology (`topologyID` argument). For instance in the
following example the opposite half edge of `e6` is `e16`.

![][imgHalfEdges]

An opposite half edge does not exist if the specified half edge has
either no neighboring face, or more than 2 neighboring faces. In these
cases the function just returns the same edge `edgeID` again.

This function can only be used for subdivision geometries. The function
depends on the topology as the topologies of a subdivision geometry
have different index buffers assigned.

rtcInterpolate
--------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcInterpolate - interpolates vertex attributes

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    struct RTCInterpolateArguments
    {
      RTCGeometry geometry;
      unsigned int primID;
      float u;
      float v;
      enum RTCBufferType bufferType;
      unsigned int bufferSlot;
      float* P;
      float* dPdu;
      float* dPdv;
      float* ddPdudu;
      float* ddPdvdv;
      float* ddPdudv;
      unsigned int valueCount;
    };

    void rtcInterpolate(
      const struct RTCInterpolateArguments* args
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcInterpolate` function smoothly interpolates per-vertex data
over the geometry. This interpolation is supported for triangle meshes,
quad meshes, curve geometries, and subdivision geometries. Apart from
interpolating the vertex attribute itself, it is also possible to get
the first and second order derivatives of that value. This
interpolation ignores displacements of subdivision surfaces and always
interpolates the underlying base surface.

The `rtcInterpolate` call gets passed a number of arguments inside a
structure of type `RTCInterpolateArguments`. For some geometry
(`geometry` parameter) this function smoothly interpolates the
per-vertex data stored inside the specified geometry buffer
(`bufferType` and `bufferSlot` parameters) to the u/v location (`u` and
`v` parameters) of the primitive (`primID` parameter). The number of
floating point values to interpolate and store to the destination
arrays can be specified using the `valueCount` parameter. As
interpolation buffer, one can specify vertex buffers
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX`) and vertex attribute buffers
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE`) as well.

The `rtcInterpolate` call stores `valueCount` number of interpolated
floating point values to the memory location pointed to by `P`. One can
avoid storing the interpolated value by setting `P` to `NULL`.

The first order derivative of the interpolation by u and v are stored
at the `dPdu` and `dPdv` memory locations. One can avoid storing first
order derivatives by setting both `dPdu` and `dPdv` to `NULL`.

The second order derivatives are stored at the `ddPdudu`, `ddPdvdv`,
and `ddPdudv` memory locations. One can avoid storing second order
derivatives by setting these three pointers to `NULL`.

To use `rtcInterpolate` for a geometry, all changes to that geometry
must be properly committed using `rtcCommitGeometry`.

All input buffers and output arrays must be padded to 16 bytes, as the
implementation uses 16-byte SSE instructions to read and write into
these buffers.

See tutorial [Interpolation] for an example of using the
`rtcInterpolate` function.

For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks,
thus will not set any error flags on failure.

    void rtcInterpolateN(
      const struct RTCInterpolateNArguments* args
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcInterpolateN` is similar to `rtcInterpolate`, but performs `N`
many interpolations at once. It additionally gets an array of u/v
coordinates and a valid mask (`valid` parameter) that specifies which
of these coordinates are valid. The valid mask points to `N` integers,
and a value of -1 denotes valid and 0 invalid. If the valid pointer is
`NULL` all elements are considers valid. The destination arrays are
filled in structure of array (SOA) layout. The value `N` must be
divisible by 4.

To use `rtcInterpolateN` for a geometry, all changes to that geometry
must be properly committed using `rtcCommitGeometry`.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks,
thus will not set any error flags on failure.

rtcNewBuffer
------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcNewBuffer - creates a new data buffer

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCBuffer rtcNewBuffer(
      RTCDevice device,
      size_t byteSize
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcNewBuffer` function creates a new data buffer object of
specified size in bytes (`byteSize` argument) that is bound to the
specified device (`device` argument). The buffer object is reference
counted with an initial reference count of 1. The returned buffer
object can be released using the `rtcReleaseBuffer` API call. The
specified number of bytes are allocated at buffer construction time and
deallocated when the buffer is destroyed.

When the buffer will be used as a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` and `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE`), the
last buffer element must be readable using 16-byte SSE load
instructions, thus padding the last element is required for certain
layouts. E.g. a standard `float3` vertex buffer layout should add
storage for at least one more float to the end of the buffer.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

On failure `NULL` is returned and an error code is set that can be
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.

rtcNewSharedBuffer
------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcNewSharedBuffer - creates a new shared data buffer

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCBuffer rtcNewSharedBuffer(
      RTCDevice device,
      void* ptr,
      size_t byteSize
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcNewSharedBuffer` function creates a new shared data buffer
object bound to the specified device (`device` argument). The buffer
object is reference counted with an initial reference count of 1. The
buffer can be released using the `rtcReleaseBuffer` function.

At construction time, the pointer to the user-managed buffer data
(`ptr` argument) including its size in bytes (`byteSize` argument) is
provided to create the buffer. At buffer construction time no buffer
data is allocated, but the buffer data provided by the application is
used. The buffer data must remain valid for as long as the buffer may
be used, and the user is responsible to free the buffer data when no
longer required.

When the buffer will be used as a vertex buffer
(`RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX` and `RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE`), the
last buffer element must be readable using 16-byte SSE load
instructions, thus padding the last element is required for certain
layouts. E.g. a standard `float3` vertex buffer layout should add
storage for at least one more float to the end of the buffer.

The data pointer (`ptr` argument) must be aligned to 4 bytes; otherwise
the `rtcNewSharedBuffer` function will fail.

On failure `NULL` is returned and an error code is set that can be
queried using `rtcGetDeviceError`.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

Buffer objects are reference counted. The `rtcRetainBuffer` function
increments the reference count of the passed buffer object (`buffer`
argument). This function together with `rtcReleaseBuffer` allows to use
the internal reference counting in a C++ wrapper class to handle the

RTCRay
------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTCRay - single ray structure

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore_ray.h>

    struct RTC_ALIGN(16) RTCRay
    {
      float org_x;        // x coordinate of ray origin
      float org_y;        // y coordinate of ray origin
      float org_z;        // z coordinate of ray origin
      float tnear;        // start of ray segment

      float dir_x;        // x coordinate of ray direction
      float dir_y;        // y coordinate of ray direction
      float dir_z;        // z coordinate of ray direction
      float time;         // time of this ray for motion blur

      float tfar;         // end of ray segment (set to hit distance)
      unsigned int mask;  // ray mask
      unsigned int id;    // ray ID
      unsigned int flags; // ray flags
    };

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `RTCRay` structure defines the ray layout for a single ray. The ray
contains the origin (`org_x`, `org_y`, `org_z` members), direction
vector (`dir_x`, `dir_y`, `dir_z` members), and ray segment (`tnear`
and `tfar` members). The ray direction does not have to be normalized,
and only the parameter range specified by the `tnear`/`tfar` interval
is considered valid.

The ray segment must be in the range $[0, \infty]$, thus ranges that
start behind the ray origin are not allowed, but ranges can reach to
infinity. For rays inside a ray stream, `tfar` \< `tnear` identifies an
inactive ray.

The ray further contains a motion blur time in the range $[0, 1]$
(`time` member), a ray mask (`mask` member), a ray ID (`id` member),
and ray flags (`flags` member). The ray mask can be used to mask out
some geometries for some rays (see `rtcSetGeometryMask` for more
details). The ray ID can be used to identify a ray inside a callback
function, even if the order of rays inside a ray packet or stream has
changed. The ray flags are reserved.

The `embree3/rtcore_ray.h` header additionally defines the same ray
structure in structure of array (SOA) layout for API functions
accepting ray packets of size 4 (`RTCRay4` type), size 8 (`RTCRay8`
type), and size 16 (`RTCRay16` type). The header additionally defines
an `RTCRayNt` template for ray packets of an arbitrary compile-time
size.

      unsigned int instID[RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT]; // instance ID
    };

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `RTCHit` type defines the type of a ray/primitive intersection
result. The hit contains the unnormalized geometric normal in object
space at the hit location (`Ng_x`, `Ng_y`, `Ng_z` members), the
barycentric u/v coordinates of the hit (`u` and `v` members), as well
as the primitive ID (`primID` member), geometry ID (`geomID` member),
and instance ID stack (`instID` member) of the hit. The parametric
intersection distance is not stored inside the hit, but stored inside
the `tfar` member of the ray.

The `embree3/rtcore_ray.h` header additionally defines the same hit
structure in structure of array (SOA) layout for hit packets of size 4
(`RTCHit4` type), size 8 (`RTCHit8` type), and size 16 (`RTCHit16`
type). The header additionally defines an `RTCHitNt` template for hit
packets of an arbitrary compile-time size.

    unsigned int& RTCRayN_id   (RTCRayN* ray, unsigned int N, unsigned int i);
    unsigned int& RTCRayN_flags(RTCRayN* ray, unsigned int N, unsigned int i);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

When the ray packet size is not known at compile time (e.g. when Embree
returns a ray packet in the `RTCFilterFuncN` callback function), Embree
uses the `RTCRayN` type for ray packets. These ray packets can only
have sizes of 1, 4, 8, or 16. No other packet size will be used.

You can either implement different special code paths for each of these
possible packet sizes and cast the ray to the appropriate ray packet
type, or implement one general code path that uses the `RTCRayN_XXX`
helper functions to access the ray packet components.

These helper functions get a pointer to the ray packet (`ray`
argument), the packet size (`N` argument), and returns a reference to a
component (e.g. x-component of origin) of the the i-th ray of the
packet (`i` argument).

    {
      RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_NONE,

      unsigned int instID[RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT];

      #if RTC_MIN_WIDTH
        float minWidthDistanceFactor;
      #endif
    };

    void rtcInitIntersectContext(
      struct RTCIntersectContext* context
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

A per ray-query intersection context (`RTCIntersectContext` type) is
supported that can be used to configure intersection flags (`flags`
member), specify a filter callback function (`filter` member), specify
the chain of IDs of the current instance (`instID` and `instStackSize`
members), and to attach arbitrary data to the query (e.g. per ray
data).

The `rtcInitIntersectContext` function initializes the context to
default values and should be called to initialize every intersection
context. This function gets inlined, which minimizes overhead and
allows for compiler optimizations.

The intersection context flag can be used to tune the behavior of the
traversal algorithm. Using the `RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_INCOHERENT`
flags uses an optimized traversal algorithm for incoherent rays
(default), while `RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_COHERENT` uses an
optimized traversal algorithm for coherent rays (e.g. primary camera
rays).

Best primary ray performance can be obtained by using the ray stream
API and setting the intersect context flag to
`RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_COHERENT`. For secondary rays, it is
typically better to use the `RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_INCOHERENT`
flag, unless the rays are known to be very coherent too (e.g. for
primary transparency rays).

A filter function can be specified inside the context. This filter
function is invoked as a second filter stage after the per-geometry
intersect or occluded filter function is invoked. Only rays that passed
the first filter stage are valid in this second filter stage. Having
such a per ray-query filter function can be useful to implement
modifications of the behavior of the query, such as collecting all hits
or accumulating transparencies. The support for the context filter
function must be enabled for a scene by using the
`RTC_SCENE_FLAG_CONTEXT_FILTER_FUNCTION` scene flag. In case of
instancing this feature has to get enabled also for each instantiated
scene.

The minWidthDistanceFactor value controls the target size of the curve
radii when the min-width feature is enabled. Please see the
[rtcSetGeometryMaxRadiusScale] function for more details on the
min-width feature.

It is guaranteed that the pointer to the intersection context passed to
a ray query is directly passed to the registered callback functions.
This way it is possible to attach arbitrary data to the end of the
intersection context, such as a per-ray payload.

Please note that the ray pointer is not guaranteed to be passed to the
callback functions, thus reading additional data from the ray pointer
passed to callbacks is not possible.

No error code is set by this function.

rtcIntersect1
-------------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcIntersect1 - finds the closest hit for a single ray

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    void rtcIntersect1(
      RTCScene scene,
      struct RTCIntersectContext* context,
      struct RTCRayHit* rayhit
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcIntersect1` function finds the closest hit of a single ray with
the scene (`scene` argument). The provided ray/hit structure (`rayhit`
argument) contains the ray to intersect and some hit output fields that
are filled when a hit is found.

The user has to initialize the ray origin (`org` ray member), ray
direction (`dir` ray member), ray segment (`tnear`, `tfar` ray
members), and set the ray flags to `0` (`flags` ray member). If the
scene contains motion blur geometries, also the ray time (`time` ray
member) must be initialized to a value in the range $[0, 1]$. If ray
masks are enabled at compile time, the ray mask (`mask` ray member)
must be initialized as well. The ray segment has to be in the range
$[0, \infty]$, thus ranges that start behind the ray origin are not
valid, but ranges can reach to infinity. See Section [RTCRay] for the
ray layout description.

The geometry ID (`geomID` hit member) of the hit data must be
initialized to `RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID` (-1).

Further, an intersection context for the ray query function must be
created and initialized (see `rtcInitIntersectContext`).

When no intersection is found, the ray/hit data is not updated. When an
intersection is found, the hit distance is written into the `tfar`
member of the ray and all hit data is set, such as unnormalized
geometry normal in object space (`Ng` hit member), local hit
coordinates (`u`, `v` hit member), instance ID stack (`instID` hit
member), geometry ID (`geomID` hit member), and primitive ID (`primID`
hit member). See Section [RTCHit] for the hit layout description.

If the instance ID stack has a prefix of values not equal to
`RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID`, the instance ID on each level corresponds to
the geometry ID of the hit instance of the higher-level scene, the
geometry ID corresponds to the hit geometry inside the hit instanced
scene, and the primitive ID corresponds to the n-th primitive of that
geometry.

If level 0 of the instance ID stack is equal to
`RTC_INVALID_GEOMETRY_ID`, the geometry ID corresponds to the hit
geometry inside the top-level scene, and the primitive ID corresponds
to the n-th primitive of that geometry.

The implementation makes no guarantees that primitives whose hit
distance is exactly at (or very close to) `tnear` or `tfar` are hit or
missed. If you want to exclude intersections at `tnear` just pass a
slightly enlarged `tnear`, and if you want to include intersections at
`tfar` pass a slightly enlarged `tfar`.

The intersection context (`context` argument) can specify flags to
optimize traversal and a filter callback function to be invoked for
every intersection. Further, the pointer to the intersection context is
propagated to callback functions invoked during traversal and can thus
be used to extend the ray with additional data. See Section
`RTCIntersectContext` for more information.

The ray pointer passed to callback functions is not guaranteed to be
identical to the original ray provided. To extend the ray with
additional data to be accessed in callback functions, use the
intersection context.

The ray/hit structure must be aligned to 16 bytes.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks,
thus will not set any error flags on failure.

    void rtcOccluded1(
      RTCScene scene,
      struct RTCIntersectContext* context,
      struct RTCRay* ray
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcOccluded1` function checks for a single ray (`ray` argument)
whether there is any hit with the scene (`scene` argument).

The user must initialize the ray origin (`org` ray member), ray
direction (`dir` ray member), ray segment (`tnear`, `tfar` ray
members), and must set the ray flags to `0` (`flags` ray member). If
the scene contains motion blur geometries, also the ray time (`time`
ray member) must be initialized to a value in the range $[0, 1]$. If
ray masks are enabled at compile time, the ray mask (`mask` ray member)
must be initialized as well. The ray segment must be in the range
$[0, \infty]$, thus ranges that start behind the ray origin are not
valid, but ranges can reach to infinity. See Section [RTCRay] for the
ray layout description.

When no intersection is found, the ray data is not updated. In case a
hit was found, the `tfar` component of the ray is set to `-inf`.

The implementation makes no guarantees that primitives whose hit
distance is exactly at (or very close to) `tnear` or `tfar` are hit or
missed. If you want to exclude intersections at `tnear` just pass a
slightly enlarged `tnear`, and if you want to include intersections at
`tfar` pass a slightly enlarged `tfar`.

The intersection context (`context` argument) can specify flags to
optimize traversal and a filter callback function to be invoked for

The `rtcIntersect4/8/16` functions finds the closest hits for a ray
packet of size 4, 8, or 16 (`rayhit` argument) with the scene (`scene`
argument). The ray/hit input contains a ray packet and hit packet. See
Section [rtcIntersect1] for a description of how to set up and trace
rays.

A ray valid mask must be provided (`valid` argument) which stores one
32-bit integer (`-1` means valid and `0` invalid) per ray in the
packet. Only active rays are processed, and hit data of inactive rays
is not changed.

The intersection context (`context` argument) can specify flags to
optimize traversal and a filter callback function to be invoked for
every intersection. Further, the pointer to the intersection context is
propagated to callback functions invoked during traversal and can thus
be used to extend the ray with additional data. See Section
`RTCIntersectContext` for more information.

The ray pointer passed to callback functions is not guaranteed to be
identical to the original ray provided. To extend the ray with
additional data to be accessed in callback functions, use the
intersection context.

The implementation of these functions is guaranteed to invoke callback
functions always with the same ray packet size and ordering of rays as
specified initially.

For `rtcIntersect4` the ray packet must be aligned to 16 bytes, for
`rtcIntersect8` the alignment must be 32 bytes, and for
`rtcIntersect16` the alignment must be 64 bytes.

The `rtcIntersect4`, `rtcIntersect8` and `rtcIntersect16` functions may
change the ray packet size and ray order when calling back into
intersect filter functions or user geometry callbacks. Under some
conditions the application can assume packets to stay intakt, which can
determined by querying the `RTC_DEVICE_PROPERTY_NATIVE_RAY4_SUPPORTED`,
`RTC_DEVICE_PROPERTY_NATIVE_RAY8_SUPPORTED`,
`RTC_DEVICE_PROPERTY_NATIVE_RAY16_SUPPORTED` properties through the
`rtcGetDeviceProperty` function. See [rtcGetDeviceProperty] for more
information.

#### EXIT STATUS {#exit-status}

For performance reasons this function does not do any error checks,
thus will not set any error flags on failure.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcOccluded4/8/16` functions checks for each active ray of the ray
packet of size 4, 8, or 16 (`ray` argument) whether there is any hit
with the scene (`scene` argument). See Section [rtcOccluded1] for a
description of how to set up and trace occlusion rays.

A ray valid mask must be provided (`valid` argument) which stores one
32-bit integer (`-1` means valid and `0` invalid) per ray in the

The implementation of these functions is guaranteed to invoke callback
functions always with the same ray packet size and ordering of rays as

For `rtcOccluded4` the ray packet must be aligned to 16 bytes, for
`rtcOccluded8` the alignment must be 32 bytes, and for `rtcOccluded16`
the alignment must be 64 bytes.

The `rtcOccluded4`, `rtcOccluded8` and `rtcOccluded16` functions may
change the ray packet size and ray order when calling back into
intersect filter functions or user geometry callbacks. Under some
conditions the application can assume packets to stay intakt, which can

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcIntersect1M` function finds the closest hits for a stream of
`M` single rays (`rayhit` argument) with the scene (`scene` argument).
The `rayhit` argument points to an array of ray and hit data with
specified byte stride (`byteStride` argument) between the ray/hit
structures. See Section [rtcIntersect1] for a description of how to
set up and trace rays.

The intersection context (`context` argument) can specify flags to
optimize traversal and a filter callback function to be invoked for
every intersection. Further, the pointer to the intersection context is
propagated to callback functions invoked during traversal and can thus
be used to extend the ray with additional data. See Section
`RTCIntersectContext` for more information.

The implementation of the stream ray query functions may re-order rays
arbitrarily and re-pack rays into ray packets of different size. For
this reason, callback functions may be invoked with an arbitrary packet
size (of size 1, 4, 8, or 16) and different ordering as specified
initially. For this reason, one may have to use the `rayID` component
of the ray to identify the original ray, e.g. to access a per-ray
payload.

A ray in a ray stream is considered inactive if its `tnear` value is
larger than its `tfar` value.

The stream size `M` can be an arbitrary positive integer including 0.
Each ray must be aligned to 16 bytes.

The `rtcIntersectNp` function finds the closest hits for a SOA ray
stream (`rays` argument) of size `N` (basically a large ray packet)

structures of pointers with one pointer for each ray and hit component.
Each of these pointers points to an array with the ray or hit component
data for each ray or hit. This way the individual components of the SOA
ray stream do not need to be stored sequentially in memory, which makes
it possible to have large varying size ray packets in SOA layout. See

rays.

#### NAME {#name}

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

      unsigned int instStackSize;
    };

    void rtcInitPointQueryContext(
      struct RTCPointQueryContext* context
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

A stack (`RTCPointQueryContext` type) which stores the IDs and instance
transformations during a BVH traversal for a point query. The
transformations are assumed to be affine transformations (3×3 matrix
plus translation) and therefore the last column is ignored (see
[RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_INSTANCE] for details).

The `rtcInitPointContext` function initializes the context to default
values and should be called for initialization.

The context will be passed as an argument to the point query callback
function (see [rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction]) and should be used
to pass instance information down the instancing chain for user defined
instancing (see tutorial [ClosestPoint] for a reference
implementation of point queries with user defined instancing).

The context is an necessary argument to [rtcPointQuery] and Embree
internally uses the topmost instance transformation of the stack to
transform the point query into instance space.

    struct RTC_ALIGN(16) RTCPointQuery
    {
      // location of the query
      float x;
      float y;
      float z;

      // radius and time of the query
      float radius;
      float time;
    };

    void rtcPointQuery(
      RTCScene scene,
      struct RTCPointQuery* query,
      struct RTCPointQueryContext* context,
      struct RTCPointQueryFunction* queryFunc,
      void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcPointQuery` function traverses the BVH using a `RTCPointQuery`
object (`query` argument) and calls a user defined callback function
(e.g `queryFunc` argument) for each primitive of the scene (`scene`
argument) that intersects the query domain.

The user has to initialize the query location (`x`, `y` and `z` member)
and query radius in the range $[0, \infty]$. If the scene contains
motion blur geometries, also the query time (`time` member) must be
initialized to a value in the range $[0, 1]$.

Further, a `RTCPointQueryContext` (`context` argument) must be created
and initialized. It contains ID and transformation information of the
instancing hierarchy if (multilevel-)instancing is used. See
[rtcInitPointQueryContext] for further information.

For every primitive that intersects the query domain, the callback
function (`queryFunc` argument) is called, in which distance
computations to the primitive can be implemented. The user will be
provided with the primID and geomID of the according primitive,
however, the geometry information (e.g. triangle index and vertex data)
has to be determined manually. The `userPtr` argument can be used to
input geometry data of the scene or output results of the point query
(e.g. closest point currently found on surface geometry (see tutorial
[ClosestPoint])).

The parameter `queryFunc` is optional and can be NULL, in which case
the callback function is not invoked. However, a callback function can
still get attached to a specific `RTCGeometry` object using
[rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction]. If a callback function is
attached to a geometry and (a potentially different) callback function
is passed as an argument to `rtcPointQuery`, both functions are called
for the primitives of the according geometries.

The query radius can be decreased inside the callback function, which
allows to efficiently cull parts of the scene during BVH traversal.
Increasing the query radius and modifying time or location of the query
will result in undefined behaviour.

The callback function will be called for all primitives in a leaf node
of the BVH even if the primitive is outside the query domain, since
Embree does not gather geometry information of primitives internally.

Point queries can be used with (multilevel)-instancing. However, care
has to be taken when the instance transformation contains anisotropic
scaling or sheering. In these cases distance computations have to be
performed in world space to ensure correctness and the ellipsoidal
query domain (in instance space) will be approximated with its axis
aligned bounding box internally. Therefore, the callback function might
be invoked even for primitives in inner BVH nodes that do not intersect
the query domain. See [rtcSetGeometryPointQueryFunction] for details.

The point query structure must be aligned to 16 bytes.

#### SUPPORTED PRIMITIVES

Currently, all primitive types are supported by the point query API
except of points (see [RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_POINT]), curves (see
[RTC\_GEOMETRY\_TYPE\_CURVE]) and sudivision surfaces (see
[RTC\_GEOMETRY\_SUBDIVISION]).

        RTCScene hscene1, 
        RTCCollideFunc callback, 
        void* userPtr
    );

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcCollide` function intersects the BVH of `hscene0` with the BVH
of scene `hscene1` and calls a user defined callback function (e.g
`callback` argument) for each pair of intersecting primitives between
the two scenes. A user defined data pointer (`userPtr` argument) can
also be passed in.

For every pair of primitives that may intersect each other, the
callback function (`callback` argument) is called. The user will be
provided with the primID's and geomID's of multiple potentially
intersecting primitive pairs. Currently, only scene entirely composed
of user geometries are supported, thus the user is expected to
implement a primitive/primitive intersection to filter out false
positives in the callback function. The `userPtr` argument can be used
to input geometry data of the scene or output results of the
intersection query.

#### SUPPORTED PRIMITIVES {#supported-primitives}

Currently, the only supported type is the user geometry type (see

rtcNewBVH
---------

#### NAME {#name}

    rtcNewBVH - creates a new BVH object

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    #include <embree3/rtcore.h>

    RTCBVH rtcNewBVH(RTCDevice device);

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

This function creates a new BVH object and returns a handle to this
BVH. The BVH object is reference counted with an initial reference
count of 1. The handle can be released using the `rtcReleaseBVH` API
call.

The BVH object can be used to build a BVH in a user-specified format
over user-specified primitives. See the documentation of the
`rtcBuildBVH` call for more details.

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The `rtcBuildBVH` function can be used to build a BVH in a user-defined
format over arbitrary primitives. All arguments to the function are
provided through the `RTCBuildArguments` structure. The first member of
that structure must be set to the size of the structure in bytes
(`bytesSize` member) which allows future extensions of the structure.
It is recommended to initialize the build arguments structure using the
`rtcDefaultBuildArguments` function.

The `rtcBuildBVH` function gets passed the BVH to build (`bvh` member),
the array of primitives (`primitives` member), the capacity of that
array (`primitiveArrayCapacity` member), the number of primitives
stored inside the array (`primitiveCount` member), callback function
pointers, and a user-defined pointer (`userPtr` member) that is passed
to all callback functions when invoked. The `primitives` array can be
freed by the application after the BVH is built. All callback functions
are typically called from multiple threads, thus their implementation
must be thread-safe.

Four callback functions must be registered, which are invoked during
build to create BVH nodes (`createNode` member), to set the pointers to
all children (`setNodeChildren` member), to set the bounding boxes of
all children (`setNodeBounds` member), and to create a leaf node
(`createLeaf` member).

The function pointer to the primitive split function (`splitPrimitive`
member) may be `NULL`, however, then no spatial splitting in high
quality mode is possible. The function pointer used to report the build
progress (`buildProgress` member) is optional and may also be `NULL`.

Further, some build settings are passed to configure the BVH build.
Using the build quality settings (`buildQuality` member), one can
select between a faster, low quality build which is good for dynamic
scenes, and a standard quality build for static scenes. One can also
specify the desired maximum branching factor of the BVH
(`maxBranchingFactor` member), the maximum depth the BVH should have
(`maxDepth` member), the block size for the SAH heuristic
(`sahBlockSize` member), the minimum and maximum leaf size
(`minLeafSize` and `maxLeafSize` member), and the estimated costs of
one traversal step and one primitive intersection (`traversalCost` and
`intersectionCost` members). When enabling the `RTC_BUILD_FLAG_DYNAMIC`
build flags (`buildFlags` member), re-build performance for dynamic
scenes is improved at the cost of higher memory requirements.

To spatially split primitives in high quality mode, the builder needs
extra space at the end of the build primitive array to store split
primitives. The total capacity of the build primitive array is passed
using the `primitiveArrayCapacity` member, and should be about twice
the number of primitives when using spatial splits.

The `RTCCreateNodeFunc` and `RTCCreateLeafFunc` callbacks are passed a
thread local allocator object that should be used for fast allocation
of nodes using the `rtcThreadLocalAlloc` function. We strongly
recommend using this allocation mechanism, as alternative approaches
like standard `malloc` can be over 10× slower. The allocator object
passed to the create callbacks may be used only inside the current
thread. Memory allocated using `rtcThreadLocalAlloc` is automatically
freed when the `RTCBVH` object is deleted. If you use your own memory
allocation scheme you have to free the memory yourself when the
`RTCBVH` object is no longer used.

The `RTCCreateNodeFunc` callback additionally gets the number of
children for this node in the range from 2 to `maxBranchingFactor`
(`childCount` argument).

The `RTCSetNodeChildFunc` callback function gets a pointer to the node
as input (`nodePtr` argument), an array of pointers to the children
(`childPtrs` argument), and the size of this array (`childCount`
argument).

The `RTCSetNodeBoundsFunc` callback function gets a pointer to the node
as input (`nodePtr` argument), an array of pointers to the bounding
boxes of the children (`bounds` argument), and the size of this array
(`childCount` argument).

The `RTCCreateLeafFunc` callback additionally gets an array of
primitives as input (`primitives` argument), and the size of this array
(`primitiveCount` argument). The callback should read the `geomID` and
`primID` members from the passed primitives to construct the leaf.

The `RTCSplitPrimitiveFunc` callback is invoked in high quality mode to
split a primitive (`primitive` argument) at the specified position
(`position` argument) and dimension (`dimension` argument). The
callback should return bounds of the clipped left and right parts of
the primitive (`leftBounds` and `rightBounds` arguments).

The `RTCProgressMonitorFunction` callback function is called with the
estimated completion rate `n` in the range $[0,1]$. Returning `true`
from the callback lets the build continue; returning `false` cancels
the build.

RTCQuaternionDecomposition
--------------------------

#### NAME {#name}

    RTCQuaternionDecomposition - structure that represents a quaternion
      decomposition of an affine transformation

#### SYNOPSIS {#synopsis}

    struct RTCQuaternionDecomposition
    {
      float scale_x, scale_y, scale_z;
      float skew_xy, skew_xz, skew_yz;
      float shift_x, shift_y, shift_z;
      float quaternion_r, quaternion_i, quaternion_j, quaternion_k;
      float translation_x, translation_y, translation_z;
    };

#### DESCRIPTION {#description}

The struct `RTCQuaternionDecomposition` represents an affine
transformation decomposed into three parts. An upper triangular
scaling/skew/shift matrix

$$
S = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
scale_x & skew_{xy} & skew_{xz} & shift_x \ 
0 & scale_y & skew_{yz} & shift_y \ 
0 & 0 & scale_z & shift_z \ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \ 
\end{array} \right),
$$

a translation matrix

$$
T = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & translation_x \ 
0 & 1 & 0 & translation_y \ 
0 & 0 & 1 & translation_z \ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \ 
\end{array} \right),
$$

and a rotation matrix $R$, represented as a quaternion

$quaternion_r + quaternion_i  \mathbf{i} + quaternion_j  \mathbf{i} + quaternion_k  \mathbf{k}$

where $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$ $\mathbf{k}$ are the imaginary
quaternion units. The passed quaternion will be normalized internally.

The affine transformation matrix corresponding to a
`RTCQuaternionDecomposition` is $TRS$ and a point
$p = (p_x, p_y, p_z, 1)^T$ will be transformed as
$$p' = T  R  S  p.$$

The functions `rtcInitQuaternionDecomposition`,
`rtcQuaternionDecompositionSetQuaternion`,
`rtcQuaternionDecompositionSetScale`,
`rtcQuaternionDecompositionSetSkew`,
`rtcQuaternionDecompositionSetShift`, and
`rtcQuaternionDecompositionSetTranslation` allow to set the fields of
the structure more conveniently.

Performance Recommendations
===========================

MXCSR control and status register
---------------------------------

It is strongly recommended to have the `Flush to Zero` and
`Denormals are Zero` mode of the MXCSR control and status register
enabled for each thread before calling the `rtcIntersect`-type and
`rtcOccluded`-type functions. Otherwise, under some circumstances
special handling of denormalized floating point numbers can
significantly reduce application and Embree performance. When using
Embree together with the Intel® Threading Building Blocks, it is
sufficient to execute the following code at the beginning of the
application main thread (before the creation of the
`tbb::task_scheduler_init` object):

    #include <xmmintrin.h>
    #include <pmmintrin.h>
    ...
    _MM_SET_FLUSH_ZERO_MODE(_MM_FLUSH_ZERO_ON);
    _MM_SET_DENORMALS_ZERO_MODE(_MM_DENORMALS_ZERO_ON);

If using a different tasking system, make sure each rendering thread
has the proper mode set.

Thread Creation and Affinity Settings
-------------------------------------

Tasking systems like TBB create worker threads on demand, which will
add a runtime overhead for the very first `rtcCommitScene` call. In
case you want to benchmark the scene build time, you should start the
threads at application startup. You can let Embree start TBB threads by
passing `start_threads=1` to the `cfg` parameter of `rtcNewDevice`.

On machines with a high thread count (e.g. dual-socket Xeon or Xeon Phi
machines), affinitizing TBB worker threads increases build and
rendering performance. You can let Embree affinitize TBB worker threads
by passing `set_affinity=1` to the `cfg` parameter of `rtcNewDevice`.
By default, threads are not affinitized by Embree with the exception of
Xeon Phi Processors where they are affinitized by default.

All Embree tutorials automatically start and affinitize TBB worker
threads by passing `start_threads=1,set_affinity=1` to `rtcNewDevice`.

Fast Coherent Rays
------------------

For getting the highest performance for highly coherent rays, e.g.
primary or hard shadow rays, it is recommended to use packets or
streams of single rays/packets with setting the
`RTC_INTERSECT_CONTEXT_FLAG_COHERENT` flag in the `RTCIntersectContext`
passed to the `rtcIntersect`/`rtcOccluded` calls. The total number of
rays in a coherent stream of ray packets should be around 64, e.g. 8
times 8-wide packets, or 4 times 16-wide packets. The rays inside each
packet should be grouped as coherent as possible.

Huge Page Support
-----------------

It is recommended to use huge pages under Linux to increase rendering
performance. Embree supports 2MB huge pages under Windows, Linux, and
macOS. Under Linux huge page support is enabled by default, and under
Windows and macOS disabled by default. Huge page support can be enabled
in Embree by passing `hugepages=1` to `rtcNewDevice` or disabled by
passing `hugepages=0` to `rtcNewDevice`.

We recommend using 2MB huge pages with Embree under Linux as this
improves ray tracing performance by about 5-10%. Under Windows using
huge pages requires the application to run in elevated mode which is a
security issue, thus likely not an option for most use cases. Under
macOS huge pages are rarely available as memory tends to get quickly
fragmented, thus we do not recommend using huge pages on macOS.

### Huge Pages under Linux

Linux supports transparent huge pages and explicit huge pages. To
enable transparent huge page support under Linux, execute the following
as root:

    echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

When transparent huge pages are enabled, the kernel tries to merge 4KB
pages to 2MB pages when possible as a background job. Many Linux
distributions have transparent huge pages enabled by default. See the
following webpage for more information on [transparent huge pages under
Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/transhuge.txt). In
this mode each application, including your rendering application based
on Embree, will automatically tend to use huge pages.

Using transparent huge pages, the transitioning from 4KB to 2MB pages
might take some time. For that reason Embree also supports allocating
2MB pages directly when a huge page pool is configured. Such a pool can
be configured by writing some number of huge pages to allocate to
`/proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages` as root user. E.g. to configure
2GB of address space for huge page allocation, execute the following as
root:

    echo 1000 > /proc/sys/vm/nr_overcommit_hugepages

See the following webpage for more information on [huge pages under
Linux](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt).

### Huge Pages under Windows

To use huge pages under Windows, the current user must have the "Lock
pages in memory" (SeLockMemoryPrivilege) assigned. This can be
configured through the "Local Security Policy" application, by adding a
user to "Local Policies" -\> "User Rights Assignment" -\> "Lock pages
in memory". You have to log out and in again for this change to take
effect.

Further, your application must be executed as an elevated process ("Run
as administrator") and the "SeLockMemoryPrivilege" must be explicitly
enabled by your application. Example code on how to enable this
privilege can be found in the "common/sys/alloc.cpp" file of Embree.
Alternatively, Embree will try to enable this privilege when passing
`enable_selockmemoryprivilege=1` to `rtcNewDevice`. Further, huge pages
should be enabled in Embree by passing `hugepages=1` to `rtcNewDevice`.

When the system has been running for a while, physical memory gets
fragmented, which can slow down the allocation of huge pages
significantly under Windows.

### Huge Pages under macOS

To use huge pages under macOS you have to pass `hugepages=1` to
`rtcNewDevice` to enable that feature in Embree.

When the system has been running for a while, physical memory gets
quickly fragmented, and causes huge page allocations to fail. For this
reason, huge pages are not very useful under macOS in practice.

Avoid store-to-load forwarding issues with single rays
------------------------------------------------------

We recommend to use a single SSE store to set up the `org` and `tnear`
components, and a single SSE store to set up the `dir` and `time`
components of a single ray (`RTCRay` type). Storing these values using
scalar stores causes a store-to-load forwarding penalty because Embree
is reading these components using SSE loads later on.



Embree Tutorials
================

Embree comes with a set of tutorials aimed at helping users understand
how Embree can be used and extended. There is a very basic minimal
that can be compiled as both C and C++, which should get new users started quickly. 
All other tutorials exist in an Intel® ISPC and C++ version to demonstrate 
the two versions of the API. Look for files
named `tutorialname_device.ispc` for the Intel® ISPC implementation of the
tutorial, and files named `tutorialname_device.cpp` for the single ray C++
version of the tutorial. To start the C++ version use the `tutorialname`
executables, to start the Intel® ISPC version use the `tutorialname_ispc`
executables. All tutorials can print available command line options
using the `--help` command line parameter.

For all tutorials except minimal, you can select an initial camera using 
the `--vp` (camera position), `--vi` (camera look-at point), `--vu` 
(camera up vector), and `--fov` (vertical field of view) command line 
parameters:

    ./triangle_geometry --vp 10 10 10 --vi 0 0 0

You can select the initial window size using the `--size` command line
parameter, or start the tutorials in full screen using the `--fullscreen`
parameter:

    ./triangle_geometry --size 1024 1024
    ./triangle_geometry --fullscreen

The initialization string for the Embree device (`rtcNewDevice` call)
can be passed to the ray tracing core through the `--rtcore` command
line parameter, e.g.:

    ./triangle_geometry --rtcore verbose=2,threads=1

The navigation in the interactive display mode follows the camera orbit
model, where the camera revolves around the current center of interest.
With the left mouse button you can rotate around the center of interest
(the point initially set with `--vi`). Holding Control pressed while
clicking the left mouse button rotates the camera around its location.
You can also use the arrow keys for navigation.

You can use the following keys:

F1
:   Default shading

F2
:   Gray EyeLight shading

F3
:   Traces occlusion rays only.

F4
:   UV Coordinate visualization

F5
:   Geometry normal visualization

F6
:   Geometry ID visualization

F7
:   Geometry ID and Primitive ID visualization

F8
:   Simple shading with 16 rays per pixel for benchmarking.

F9
:   Switches to render cost visualization. Pressing again reduces
    brightness.

F10
:   Switches to render cost visualization. Pressing again increases
    brightness.

f
:   Enters or leaves full screen mode.

c
:   Prints camera parameters.

ESC
:   Exits the tutorial.

q
:   Exits the tutorial.

Minimal
-------

This tutorial is designed to get new users started with Embree.
It can be compiled as both C and C++. It demonstrates how to initialize
a device and scene, and how to intersect rays with the scene.
There is no image output to keep the tutorial as simple as possible.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/minimal/minimal.cpp)

Triangle Geometry
-----------------

[![][imgTriangleGeometry]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/triangle_geometry/triangle_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates the creation of a static cube and ground
plane using triangle meshes. It also demonstrates the use of the
`rtcIntersect1` and `rtcOccluded1` functions to render primary visibility
and hard shadows. The cube sides are colored based on the ID of the hit
primitive.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/triangle_geometry/triangle_geometry_device.cpp)

Dynamic Scene
-------------

[![][imgDynamicScene]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/dynamic_scene/dynamic_scene_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates the creation of a dynamic scene, consisting
of several deforming spheres. Half of the spheres use the
`RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_REFIT` geometry build quality, which allows Embree
to use a refitting strategy for these spheres, the other half uses the
`RTC_BUILD_QUALITY_LOW` geometry build quality, causing a high
performance rebuild of their spatial data structure each frame. The
spheres are colored based on the ID of the hit sphere geometry.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/dynamic_scene/dynamic_scene_device.cpp)

Multi Scene Geometry
-------------

[![][imgDynamicScene]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/multiscene_geometry/multiscene_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates the creation of multiple scenes sharing the
same geometry objects.  Here, three scenes are built.  One with all
the dynamic spheres of the Dynamic Scene test and two others each with
half.  The ground plane is shared by all three scenes.  The space bar
is used to cycle the scene chosen for rendering.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/multiscene_geometry/multiscene_geometry_device.cpp)

User Geometry
-------------

[![][imgUserGeometry]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/user_geometry/user_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial shows the use of user-defined geometry, to re-implement
instancing, and to add analytic spheres. A two-level scene is created,
with a triangle mesh as ground plane, and several user geometries that
instance other scenes with a small number of spheres of different kinds.
The spheres are colored using the instance ID and geometry ID of the hit
sphere, to demonstrate how the same geometry instanced in different
ways can be distinguished.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/user_geometry/user_geometry_device.cpp)

Viewer
------

[![][imgViewer]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/viewer/viewer_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates a simple OBJ viewer that traces primary
visibility rays only. A scene consisting of multiple meshes is created,
each mesh sharing the index and vertex buffer with the application.
It also demonstrates how to support additional per-vertex data, such as
shading normals.

You need to specify an OBJ file at the command line for this tutorial to
work:

    ./viewer -i model.obj

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/viewer/viewer_device.cpp)

Stream Viewer
-------------

[![][imgViewerStream]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/viewer_stream/viewer_stream_device.cpp)

This tutorial is a simple OBJ viewer that demonstrates the use of ray
streams. You need to specify an OBJ file at the command line for this
tutorial to work:

    ./viewer_stream -i model.obj

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/viewer_stream/viewer_stream_device.cpp)

Intersection Filter
-------------------

[![][imgIntersectionFilter]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/intersection_filter/intersection_filter_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates the use of filter callback functions to
efficiently implement transparent objects. The filter function used for
primary rays lets the ray pass through the geometry if it is entirely
transparent. Otherwise, the shading loop handles the transparency
properly, by potentially shooting secondary rays. The filter function
used for shadow rays accumulates the transparency of all surfaces along
the ray, and terminates traversal if an opaque occluder is hit.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/intersection_filter/intersection_filter_device.cpp)

Instanced Geometry
------------------

[![][imgInstancedGeometry]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/instanced_geometry/instanced_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates the in-build instancing feature of Embree, by
instancing a number of other scenes built from triangulated spheres. The
spheres are again colored using the instance ID and geometry ID of the
hit sphere, to demonstrate how the same geometry instanced in different
ways can be distinguished.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/instanced_geometry/instanced_geometry_device.cpp)

Multi Level Instancing
----------------------

[![][imgMultiLevelInstancing]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/multi_instanced_geometry/multi_instanced_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates multi-level instancing, i.e., nesting instances
into instances. To enable the tutorial, set the compile-time variable
`EMBREE_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT` to a value other than the default 1.
This variable is available in the code as `RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT`.

The renderer uses a basic path tracing approach, and the
image will progressively refine over time.
There are two levels of instances in this scene: multiple instances of
the same tree nest instances of a twig.
Intersections on up to `RTC_MAX_INSTANCE_LEVEL_COUNT` nested levels of
instances work out of the box. Users may obtain the *instance ID stack* for
a given hitpoint from the `instID` member.
During shading, the instance ID stack is used to accumulate
normal transformation matrices for each hit. The tutorial visualizes
transformed normals as colors.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/multi_instanced_geometry/multi_instanced_geometry_device.cpp)

Path Tracer
-----------

[![][imgPathtracer]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/pathtracer/pathtracer_device.cpp)

This tutorial is a simple path tracer, based on the viewer tutorial.

You need to specify an OBJ file and light source at the command line for
this tutorial to work:

    ./pathtracer -i model.obj --ambientlight 1 1 1

As example models we provide the "Austrian Imperial Crown" model by
[Martin Lubich](http://www.loramel.net) and the "Asian Dragon" model from the
[Stanford 3D Scanning Repository](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/).

[crown.zip](https://github.com/embree/models/releases/download/release/crown.zip)

[asian_dragon.zip](https://github.com/embree/models/releases/download/release/asian_dragon.zip)

Motion Blur Geometry
--------------------

[![][imgMotionBlurGeometry]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/motion_blur_geometry/motion_blur_geometry_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates rendering of motion blur using the
multi-segment motion blur feature. Shown is motion blur of a triangle mesh,
quad mesh, subdivision surface, line segments, hair geometry, Bézier
curves, instantiated triangle mesh where the instance moves,
instantiated quad mesh where the instance and the quads move, and user
geometry.

The number of time steps used can be configured using the `--time-steps
<int>` and `--time-steps2 <int>` command line parameters, and the
geometry can be rendered at a specific time using the the `--time
<float>` command line parameter.

Closest Point
----------------------

[![][imgClosestPoint]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/closest_point/closest_point_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates a use-case of the point query API. The scene
consists of a simple collection of objects that are instanced and for several
point in the scene (red points) the closest point on the surfaces of the
scene are computed (white points). The closest point functionality is
implemented for Embree internal and for user-defined instancing. The tutorial
also illustrates how to handle instance transformations that are not
similarity transforms.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/closest_point/closest_point_device.cpp)

Voronoi
----------------------

[![][imgVoronoi]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/voronoi/voronoi_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement nearest neighbour lookups using
the point query API. Several colored points are located on a plane and the
corresponding voroni regions are illustrated.

Collision Detection
----------------------

[![][imgCollision]](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/collide/collide_device.cpp)

This tutorial demonstrates how to implement collision detection using
the collide API. A simple cloth solver is setup to collide with a sphere.

The cloth can be reset with the `space` bar.  The sim stepped once with `n` 
and continuous simulation started and paused with `p`.

BVH Builder
-----------

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the templated hierarchy builders
of Embree to build a bounding volume hierarchy with a user-defined
memory layout using a high-quality SAH builder using spatial splits, a
standard SAH builder, and a very fast Morton builder.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/bvh_builder/bvh_builder_device.cpp)

BVH Access
-----------

This tutorial demonstrates how to access the internal triangle
acceleration structure build by Embree. Please be aware that the
internal Embree data structures might change between Embree updates.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/bvh_access/bvh_access.cpp)

Find Embree
-----------

This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `FIND_PACKAGE` CMake feature
to use an installed Embree. Under Linux and macOS the tutorial finds
the Embree installation automatically, under Windows the `embree_DIR`
CMake variable must be set to the following folder of the Embree
installation: `C:\Program Files\Intel\Embree3`.

[Source Code](https://github.com/embree/embree/blob/master/tutorials/find_embree/CMakeLists.txt)

Next Hit
-----------

This tutorial demonstrates how to robustly enumerate all hits along
the ray using multiple ray queries and an intersection filter
function. To improve performance, the tutorial also supports
collecting the next N hits in a single ray query.
