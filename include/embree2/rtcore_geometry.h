/*! \brief Creates a new subdivision mesh. The number of faces
 (numFaces), edges/indices (numEdges), vertices (numVertices), edge
 creases (numEdgeCreases), vertex creases (numVertexCreases), holes
 (numHoles), and time steps (numTimeSteps) have to get speficied at
 construction time.

 The following buffers have to get filled by the application: the face
 buffer (RTC_FACE_BUFFER) contains the number edges/indices (3 or 4)
 of each of the numFaces faces, the index buffer (RTC_INDEX_BUFFER)
 contains multiple (3 or 4) 32bit vertex indices for each face and
 numEdges indices in total, the vertex buffer (RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER)
 stores numVertices vertices as single precision x,y,z floating point
 coordinates aligned to 16 bytes. The value of the 4th float used for
 alignment can be arbitrary. In case of multi-segment motion blur,
 multiple vertex buffers have to get filled (RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER0,
 RTC_VERTEX_BUFFER1, etc.), one for each time step.

 Optionally, the application can fill the hole buffer
 (RTC_HOLE_BUFFER) with numHoles many 32 bit indices of faces that
 should be considered non-existing.

 Optionally, the application can fill the level buffer
 (RTC_LEVEL_BUFFER) with a tessellation level for each of the numEdges
 edges. The subdivision level is a positive floating point value, that
 specifies how many quads along the edge should get generated during
 tessellation. The tessellation level is a lower bound, thus the
 implementation is free to choose a larger level. If no level buffer
 is specified a level of 1 is used.

 Optionally, the application can fill the sparse edge crease buffers
 to make some edges appear sharper. The edge crease index buffer
 (RTC_EDGE_CREASE_INDEX_BUFFER) contains numEdgeCreases many pairs of
 32 bit vertex indices that specify unoriented edges. The edge crease
 weight buffer (RTC_EDGE_CREASE_WEIGHT_BUFFER) stores for each of
 theses crease edges a positive floating point weight. The larger this
 weight, the sharper the edge. Specifying a weight of infinify is
 supported and marks an edge as infinitely sharp. Storing an edge
 multiple times with the same crease weight is allowed, but has lower
 performance. Storing the an edge multiple times with different
 crease weights results in undefined behaviour. For a stored edge
 (i,j), the reverse direction edges (j,i) does not have to get stored,
 as both are considered the same edge.

 Optionally, the application can fill the sparse vertex crease buffers
 to make some vertices appear sharper. The vertex crease index buffer
 (RTC_VERTEX_CREASE_INDEX_BUFFER), contains numVertexCreases many 32
 bit vertex indices to speficy a set of vertices. The vertex crease
 weight buffer (RTC_VERTEX_CREASE_WEIGHT_BUFFER) specifies for each of
 these vertices a positive floating point weight. The larger this
 weight, the sharper the vertex. Specifying a weight of infinity is
 supported and makes the vertex infinitely sharp. Storing a vertex
 multiple times with the same crease weight is allowed, but has lower
 performance. Storing a vertex multiple times with different crease
 weights results in undefined behaviour.
