      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor
      and its affiliates, except as required to comply with Section 4(c) of
      the License and to reproduce the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

11.1 Intel(R) oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler


Intel End User License Agreement for Developer Tools (Version October 2021)

 

IMPORTANT NOTICE - PLEASE READ AND AGREE BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR USING

This Agreement is between you, or the company or other legal entity that you represent and warrant you have the legal authority to bind, (each, "You" or "Your") and Intel Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Intel") regarding Your use of the Materials. By downloading, installing, copying or using the Materials, You agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, or do not have legal authority or required age to agree to them, do not download, install, copy or use the Materials.

 

LICENSE DEFINITIONS.

 

A.    "Cloud Provider" means a third party service provider offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application or storage services, such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services, which You may only utilize to host the Materials subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.3 B.

 

B.    "Derivative Work" means a derivative work, as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101, of the Source Code.

 

C.    "Executable Code" means computer programming code in binary form suitable for machine execution by a processor without the intervening steps of interpretation or compilation.

 

D.    "Materials" mean the software, documentation, the software product serial number, and other collateral, including any updates, made available to You by Intel under this Agreement. Materials include Redistributables, Executable Code, Source Code, Sample Source Code, and Pre-Release Materials, but do not include Third Party Software.

 

E.    "Pre-Release Materials" mean the Materials, or portions of the Materials, that are identified (in the product release notes, on Intel's download website for the Materials or elsewhere) or labeled as pre-release, prototype, alpha or beta code and, as such, are deemed to be pre-release code (i) which may not be fully functional or tested and may contain bugs or errors; (ii) which Intel may substantially modify in its development of a production version; or (iii) for which Intel makes no assurances that it will ever develop or make a production version generally available. Pre-Release Materials are subject to the terms of Section 3.2.

 

F.    "Reciprocal Open Source Software" means any software that is subject to a license which requires that (i) it must be distributed in source code form; (ii) it must be licensed under the same open source license terms; and (iii) its derivative works must be licensed under the same open source license terms. Examples of this type of license are the GNU General Public License or the Mozilla Public License.

 

G.    "Redistributables" mean the files (if any) listed in the "redist.txt," "redist-rt.txt" or similarlynamed text files that may be included in the Materials. Redistributables include Sample Source Code.

 

H.    "Sample Source Code" means those portions of the Materials that are Source Code and are identified as sample code. Sample Source Code may not have been tested or validated by Intel and is provided purely as a programming example.

 

I.      "Source Code" means the software portion of the Materials provided in human readable format.

 

J.     "Third Party Software" mean the files (if any) listed in the "third-party-software.txt" or other similarly-named text file that may be included in the Materials for the applicable software.
Third Party Software is subject to the terms of Section 2.2.

 

K.    "Your Product" means one or more applications, products or projects developed by or for You using the Materials.

 

2.     LICENSE GRANTS.

 

2.1      License to the Materials. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Intel grants You a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license under its copyrights, to:

 

A.    reproduce internally a reasonable number of copies of the Materials for Your personal or business use;

 

B.    use the Materials solely for Your personal or business use to develop Your Product, in accordance with the documentation included as part of the Materials;

 

C.    modify or create Derivative Works only of the Redistributables, or any portions, that are provided to You in Source Code;

 

D.    distribute (directly and through Your distributors, resellers, and other channel partners, if applicable), the Redistributables, including any modifications to or Derivative Works of the Redistributables or any portions made pursuant to Section 2.1.C subject to the following conditions:

 

(1)   Any distribution of the Redistributables must only be as part of Your Product which must add significant primary functionality different than that of the Redistributables themselves;

 

(2)   You must only distribute the Redistributables originally provided to You by Intel only in Executable Code subject to a license agreement that prohibits reverse engineering, decompiling or disassembling the Redistributables;

 

(3)   This distribution right includes a limited right to sublicense only the Intel copyrights in the Redistributables and only to the extent necessary to perform, display, and distribute the Redistributables (including Your modifications and Derivative Works of the Redistributables provided in Source Code) solely as incorporated in Your Product; and

 

(4)   You: (i) will be solely responsible to Your customers for any update, support obligation or other obligation or liability which may arise from the distribution of Your Product, (ii) will not make any statement that Your Product is "certified" or that its performance is guaranteed by Intel or its suppliers, (iii) will not use Intel's or its suppliers' names or trademarks to market Your Product, (iv) will comply with any additional restrictions which are included in the text files with the Redistributables and in Section 3 below, (v) will indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Intel and its suppliers from and against any claims or lawsuits, costs, damages, and expenses, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from (a) Your modifications or Derivative Works of the Materials or (b) Your distribution of Your Product.

 

2.2      Third Party Software. Third Party Software, even if included with the distribution of the Materials, may be governed by separate license terms, including without limitation, third party license terms, open source software notices and terms, and/or other Intel software license terms. These separate license terms solely govern Your use of the Third Party Software.
