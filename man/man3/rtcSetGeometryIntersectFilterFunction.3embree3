.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]rtcSetGeometryIntersectFilterFunction\f[] function registers an
intersection filter callback function (\f[C]filter\f[] argument) for the
specified geometry (\f[C]geometry\f[] argument).
.PP
Only a single callback function can be registered per geometry, and
further invocations overwrite the previously set callback function.
Passing \f[C]NULL\f[] as function pointer disables the registered
callback function.
.PP
The registered intersection filter function is invoked for every hit
encountered during the \f[C]rtcIntersect\f[]\-type ray queries and can
accept or reject that hit.
The feature can be used to define a silhouette for a primitive and
reject hits that are outside the silhouette.
E.g.
a tree leaf could be modeled with an alpha texture that decides whether
hit points lie inside or outside the leaf.
.PP
If the \f[C]RTC_SCENE_HIGH_QUALITY\f[] mode is set, the filter functions
may be called multiple times for the same primitive hit.
Further, rays hitting exactly the edge might also report two hits for
the same surface.
For certain use cases, the application may have to work around this
limitation by collecting already reported hits
(\f[C]geomID\f[]/\f[C]primID\f[] pairs) and ignoring duplicates.
.PP
The filter function callback of type \f[C]RTCFilterFunctionN\f[] gets
passed a number of arguments through the
\f[C]RTCFilterFunctionNArguments\f[] structure.
The \f[C]valid\f[] parameter of that structure points to an integer
valid mask (0 means invalid and \-1 means valid).
The \f[C]geometryUserPtr\f[] member is a user pointer optionally set per
geometry through the \f[C]rtcSetGeometryUserData\f[] function.
The \f[C]context\f[] member points to the intersection context passed to
the ray query function.
The \f[C]ray\f[] parameter points to \f[C]N\f[] rays in SOA layout.
The \f[C]hit\f[] parameter points to \f[C]N\f[] hits in SOA layout to
test.
The \f[C]N\f[] parameter is the number of rays and hits in \f[C]ray\f[]
and \f[C]hit\f[].
The hit distance is provided as the \f[C]tfar\f[] value of the ray.
If the hit geometry is instanced, the \f[C]instID\f[] member of the ray
is valid, and the ray and the potential hit are in object space.
.PP
The filter callback function has the task to check for each valid ray
whether it wants to accept or reject the corresponding hit.
To reject a hit, the filter callback function just has to write
\f[C]0\f[] to the integer valid mask of the corresponding ray.
To accept the hit, it just has to leave the valid mask set to
\f[C]\-1\f[].
The filter function is further allowed to change the hit and decrease
the \f[C]tfar\f[] value of the ray but it should not modify other ray
data nor any inactive components of the ray or hit.

.PP
The implementation of the filter function can choose to implement a
single code path that uses the ray access helper functions
\f[C]RTCRay_XXX\f[] and hit access helper functions \f[C]RTCHit_XXX\f[]
to access ray and hit data.
Alternatively the code can branch to optimized implementations for
specific sizes of \f[C]N\f[] and cast the \f[C]ray\f[] and \f[C]hit\f[]
inputs to the proper packet types.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
\f[C]rtcGetDeviceError\f[].
