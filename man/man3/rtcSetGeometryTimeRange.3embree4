.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]rtcSetGeometryTimeRange\f[R] function sets a time range which
defines the start (and end time) of the first (and last) time step of a
motion blur geometry.
The time range is defined relative to the camera shutter interval [0,1]
but it can be arbitrary.
Thus the startTime can be smaller, equal, or larger 0, indicating a
geometry whose animation definition start before, at, or after the
camera shutter opens.
Similar the endTime can be smaller, equal, or larger than 1, indicating
a geometry whose animation definition ends after, at, or before the
camera shutter closes.
The startTime has to be smaller or equal to the endTime.
.PP
The default time range when this function is not called is the entire
camera shutter [0,1].
For best performance at most one time segment of the piece wise linear
definition of the motion should fall outside the shutter window to the
left and to the right.
Thus do not set the startTime or endTime too far outside the [0,1]
interval for best performance.
.PP
This time range feature will also allow geometries to appear and
disappear during the camera shutter time if the specified time range is
a sub range of [0,1].
.PP
Please also have a look at the \f[V]rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount\f[R]
function to see how to define the time steps for the specified time
range.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure an error code is set that can be queried using
\f[V]rtcGetDeviceError\f[R].
