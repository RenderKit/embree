.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
Catmull-Clark subdivision meshes are supported, including support for
edge creases, vertex creases, holes, non-manifold geometry, and
face-varying interpolation.
The number of vertices per face can be in the range of 3 to 15 vertices
(triangles, quadrilateral, pentagons, etc).
.PP
Subdivision meshes are created by passing
\f[V]RTC_GEOMETRY_TYPE_SUBDIVISION\f[R] to the \f[V]rtcNewGeometry\f[R]
function.
Various buffers need to be set by the application to set up the
subdivision mesh.
See \f[V]rtcSetGeometryBuffer\f[R] and
\f[V]rtcSetSharedGeometryBuffer\f[R] for more details on how to set
buffers.
The face buffer (\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FACE\f[R] type and
\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_UINT\f[R] format) contains the number of edges/indices
of each face (3 to 15), and the number of faces is inferred from the
size of this buffer.
The index buffer (\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX\f[R] type) contains
multiple (3 to 15) 32-bit vertex indices (\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_UINT\f[R]
format) for each face, and the number of edges is inferred from the size
of this buffer.
The vertex buffer (\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX\f[R] type) stores an
array of single precision \f[V]x\f[R], \f[V]y\f[R], \f[V]z\f[R] floating
point coordinates (\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT3\f[R] format), and the number
of vertices is inferred from the size of this buffer.
.PP
Optionally, the application may set additional index buffers using
different buffer slots if multiple topologies are required for
face-varying interpolation.
The standard vertex buffers (\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX\f[R]) are
always bound to the geometry topology (topology 0) thus use
\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX\f[R] with buffer slot 0.
User vertex data interpolation may use different topologies as described
later.
.PP
Optionally, the application can set up the hole buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_HOLE\f[R]) which contains an array of 32-bit
indices (\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_UINT\f[R] format) of faces that should be
considered non-existing in all topologies.
The number of holes is inferred from the size of this buffer.
.PP
Optionally, the application can fill the level buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_LEVEL\f[R]) with a tessellation rate for each of
the edges of each face.
This buffer must have the same size as the index buffer.
The tessellation level is a positive floating point value
(\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT\f[R] format) that specifies how many quads along
the edge should be generated during tessellation.
If no level buffer is specified, a level of 1 is used.
The maximally supported edge level is 4096, and larger levels are
clamped to that value.
Note that edges may be shared between (typically 2) faces.
To guarantee a watertight tessellation, the level of these shared edges
should be identical.
A uniform tessellation rate for an entire subdivision mesh can be set by
using the \f[V]rtcSetGeometryTessellationRate\f[R] function.
The existence of a level buffer has precedence over the uniform
tessellation rate.
.PP
Optionally, the application can fill the sparse edge crease buffers to
make edges appear sharper.
The edge crease index buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_INDEX\f[R]) contains an array of pairs
of 32-bit vertex indices (\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_UINT2\f[R] format) that
specify unoriented edges in the geometry topology.
The edge crease weight buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_EDGE_CREASE_WEIGHT\f[R]) stores for each of these
crease edges a positive floating point weight
(\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT\f[R] format).
The number of edge creases is inferred from the size of these buffers,
which has to be identical.
The larger a weight, the sharper the edge.
Specifying a weight of infinity is supported and marks an edge as
infinitely sharp.
Storing an edge multiple times with the same crease weight is allowed,
but has lower performance.
Storing an edge multiple times with different crease weights results in
undefined behavior.
For a stored edge (i,j), the reverse direction edges (j,i) do not have
to be stored, as both are considered the same unoriented edge.
Edge crease features are shared between all topologies.
.PP
Optionally, the application can fill the sparse vertex crease buffers to
make vertices appear sharper.
The vertex crease index buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_INDEX\f[R]), contains an array of
32-bit vertex indices (\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_UINT\f[R] format) to specify a
set of vertices from the geometry topology.
The vertex crease weight buffer
(\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_CREASE_WEIGHT\f[R]) specifies for each of
these vertices a positive floating point weight
(\f[V]RTC_FORMAT_FLOAT\f[R] format).
The number of vertex creases is inferred from the size of these buffers,
and has to be identical.
The larger a weight, the sharper the vertex.
Specifying a weight of infinity is supported and makes the vertex
infinitely sharp.
Storing a vertex multiple times with the same crease weight is allowed,
but has lower performance.
Storing a vertex multiple times with different crease weights results in
undefined behavior.
Vertex crease features are shared between all topologies.
.PP
Subdivision modes can be used to force linear interpolation for parts of
the subdivision mesh; see \f[V]rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode\f[R] for
more details.
.PP
For multi-segment motion blur, the number of time steps must be first
specified using the \f[V]rtcSetGeometryTimeStepCount\f[R] call.
Then a vertex buffer for each time step can be set using different
buffer slots, and all these buffers have to have the same stride and
size.
.PP
Also see tutorial [Subdivision Geometry] for an example of how to create
subdivision surfaces.
.SS Parametrization
.PP
The parametrization for subdivision faces is different for
quadrilaterals and non-quadrilateral faces.
.PP
The parametrization of a quadrilateral face uses the first vertex
\f[V]p0\f[R] as base point, and the vector \f[V]p1 - p0\f[R] as
u-direction and \f[V]p3 - p0\f[R] as v-direction.
.PP
The parametrization for all other face types (with number of vertices
not equal 4), have a special parametrization where the subpatch ID
\f[V]n\f[R] (of the \f[V]n\f[R]-th quadrilateral that would be obtained
by a single subdivision step) and the local hit location inside this
quadrilateral are encoded in the UV coordinates.
The following code extracts the sub-patch ID \f[V]i\f[R] and local UVs
of this subpatch:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
unsigned int l = floorf(0.5f*U);
unsigned int h = floorf(0.5f*V);
unsigned int i = 4*h+l;
float u = 2.0f*fracf(0.5f*U)-0.5f;
float v = 2.0f*fracf(0.5f*V)-0.5f;
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This encoding allows local subpatch UVs to be in the range
\f[V][-0.5,1.5[\f[R] thus negative subpatch UVs can be passed to
\f[V]rtcInterpolate\f[R] to sample subpatches slightly out of bounds.
This can be useful to calculate derivatives using finite differences if
required.
The encoding further has the property that one can just move the value
\f[V]u\f[R] (or \f[V]v\f[R]) on a subpatch by adding \f[V]du\f[R] (or
\f[V]dv\f[R]) to the special UV encoding as long as it does not fall out
of the \f[V][-0.5,1.5[\f[R] range.
.PP
To smoothly interpolate vertex attributes over the subdivision surface
we recommend using the \f[V]rtcInterpolate\f[R] function, which will
apply the standard subdivision rules for interpolation and automatically
takes care of the special UV encoding for non-quadrilaterals.
.SS Face-Varying Data
.PP
Face-varying interpolation is supported through multiple topologies per
subdivision mesh and binding such topologies to vertex attribute buffers
to interpolate.
This way, texture coordinates may use a different topology with
additional boundaries to construct separate UV regions inside one
subdivision mesh.
.PP
Each such topology \f[V]i\f[R] has a separate index buffer (specified
using \f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_INDEX\f[R] with buffer slot \f[V]i\f[R]) and
separate subdivision mode that can be set using
\f[V]rtcSetGeometrySubdivisionMode\f[R].
A vertex attribute buffer \f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_VERTEX_ATTRIBUTE\f[R]
bound to a buffer slot \f[V]j\f[R] can be assigned to use a topology for
interpolation using the \f[V]rtcSetGeometryVertexAttributeTopology\f[R]
call.
.PP
The face buffer (\f[V]RTC_BUFFER_TYPE_FACE\f[R] type) is shared between
all topologies, which means that the \f[V]n\f[R]-th primitive always has
the same number of vertices (e.g.\ being a triangle or a quad) for each
topology.
However, the indices of the topologies themselves may be different.
.SS EXIT STATUS
.PP
On failure \f[V]NULL\f[R] is returned and an error code is set that can
be queried using \f[V]rtcGetDeviceError\f[R].
