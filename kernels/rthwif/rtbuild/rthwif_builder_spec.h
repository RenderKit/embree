   \brief This file contains a Level Zero API extension to build ray
   tracing acceleration structures to be used with an OpenCL ray
   tracing API extension.


   Ray Tracing Acceleration Structure Build API
   ============================================

   The L0 ray tracing acceleration structure build API provides
   functionality to build acceleration structures for 3D scenes on the
   host, which can get used for ray tracing on GPU devices.

   It is the users responsibility to manage the acceleration structure
   buffer allocation and deallocation. The required size of the
   accleration structure buffer can be queried with the
   zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt function and the acceleration structure
   an get build on the host using the zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt
   function.

   To build an acceleration structure one first has to setup a scene
   that consists of multiple geometry descriptors, such as
   ze_raytracing_geometry_triangles_ext_desc_t for triangle meshes,
   ze_raytracing_geometry_quads_ext_desc_t for quad meshes,
   ze_raytracing_geometry_aabbs_fptr_ext_desc_t for procedural
   primitives with attached axis aligned bounding box, and
   ze_raytracing_geometry_instance_ext_desc_t for instances of other
   acceleration structures.

   The followign example creates an
   ze_raytracing_geometry_triangles_ext_desc_t descriptor to specify
   a triangle mesh with triangles indices and vertices stored
   inside two vectors:

     ze_raytracing_geometry_triangles_ext_desc_t mesh;
     memset(&mesh,0,sizeof(mesh));
     mesh.geometryType = ZE_RAYTRACING_GEOMETRY_TYPE_EXT_TRIANGLES;
     mesh.geometryFlags = ZE_RAYTRACING_GEOMETRY_EXT_FLAG_OPAQUE;
     mesh.geometryMask = 0xFF;

     mesh.triangleFormat = ZE_RAYTRACING_FORMAT_EXT_TRIANGLE_INDICES_UINT32;
     mesh.triangleCount = triangles.size();
     mesh.triangleStride = 12;
     mesh.triangleBuffer = triangles.data();

     mesh.vertexFormat = ZE_RAYTRACING_FORMAT_EXT_FLOAT3;
     mesh.vertexCount = vertices.size();
     mesh.vertexStride = 12;
     mesh.vertexBuffer = vertices.data();
   
  The specified geometry flag ZE_RAYTRACING_GEOMETRY_EXT_FLAG_OPAQUE
  enables a fast mode where traveral does not return to the caller of
  ray tracing for each hit. The proper data formats of the triangle
  and vertex buffer is specified, including the strides, and pointer
  to first elements in these buffers.
  
  To refer to multiple of these geometries that make a scene, pointers to
  these descriptors can be put into an array as follows:

    std::vector<ze_raytracing_geometry_ext_desc_t*> geometries;
    geometries.push_back((ze_raytracing_geometry_ext_desc_t*)&mesh);
    geometries.push_back((ze_raytracing_geometry_ext_desc_t*)&mesh1);
    ...

  This completes the definition of the geometry for the scene to
  construct the acceleration structure for.

  Next we need to query the format of the acceleration structure of
  the device we want to use for ray tracing:

    ze_raytracing_accel_format_ext_t accelFormat;
    ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingDeviceGetAccelFormatExt( hDevice, &accelFormat );

  To initiate the BVH build
  one first fills the ze_raytracing_build_accel_ext_desc_t structure
  with all arguments required for the acceleration structure build as
  in the following example:
    
    ze_raytracing_build_accel_ext_desc_t build_desc;
    memset(&build_desc,0,sizeof(build_desc));
    build_desc.stype = ZE_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RAYTRACING_BUILD_ACCEL_EXT_DESC;
    build_desc.pNext = nullptr;
    build_desc.accelFormat = accelFormat;
    build_desc.geometries = geometries.data(); 
    build_desc.numGeometries = geometries.size();
    build_desc.quality = ZE_RAYTRACING_BUILD_QUALITY_EXT_MEDIUM;
    build_desc.flags = ZE_RAYTRACING_BUILD_EXT_FLAG_NONE;

  Besides just passing a pointer to the geometries array this, passes
  the desired acceleration structure format, and sets some default
  build flags for a medium quality acceleration structure. Next the
  application has to query the buffer sizes required for the
  acceleration strucuture and scratch memory required for the build
  like in this example:

    ze_raytracing_accel_size_ext_properties_t accel_size;
    memset(&accel_size,0,sizeof(accel_size));
    accel_size.stype = ZE_STRUCTURE_TYPE_RAYTRACING_ACCEL_SIZE_EXT_PROPERTIES;
    accel_size.pNext = nullptr;

    ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt( &build_desc, &accel_size );
    assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);

  This queries the buffer sizes for the build operation specified in
  the provided build descriptor. Note that the sizes are only correct
  for the provided build descriptor, thus if parameters such as the
  build quality get changed for the actual build, calculated sizes are
  invalid.

  Now we allocate the scratch buffer:

    void* scratchBuffer = malloc(accel_size.scratchBufferBytes);

  and the acceleration structure buffer using the worst cast
  estimates:
  
    ze_raytracing_mem_alloc_ext_desc_t rt_desc;
    rt_desc.stype = ZE_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_RAYTRACING_EXT_PROPERTIES;
    rt_desc.pNext = nullptr;
    rt_desc.flags = 0;

    ze_device_mem_alloc_desc_t device_desc;
    device_desc.stype = ZE_STRUCTURE_TYPE_DEVICE_MEM_ALLOC_DESC;
    device_desc.pNext = &rt_desc;
    device_desc.flags = ZE_DEVICE_MEM_ALLOC_FLAG_BIAS_CACHED;
    device_desc.ordinal = 0;
  
    ze_host_mem_alloc_desc_t host_desc;
    host_desc.stype = ZE_STRUCTURE_TYPE_HOST_MEM_ALLOC_DESC;
    host_desc.pNext = nullptr;
    host_desc.flags = ZE_HOST_MEM_ALLOC_FLAG_BIAS_CACHED;
    
    void* accelBuffer = nullptr;
    ze_result_t result = zeMemAllocShared(hContext,
                                          &device_desc, &host_desc,
                                          accel_size.accelBufferWorstCaseBytes, 
                                          ZE_RAYTRACING_ACCELERATION_STRUCTURE_ALIGNMENT_EXT,
                                          hDevice,&accelBuffer);
    assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);

    
  When using worst case estimate for the acceleration structure
  buffer, the build of the acceleration structure is guaranteed not to
  run out of memory.

  To initiate the build operation we need to additionally specify the
  just created buffers in the build descriptor:

    build_desc.accelBuffer = accelBuffer;
    build_desc.accelBufferBytes = accel_size.accelBufferWorstCaseBytes;

    build_desc.scratchBuffer = scratchBuffer;
    build_desc.scratchBufferBytes = accelsize.scratchBufferBytes;


  Now a single threaded build on the host CPU can get initiated using
  the zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt function:

    ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt( &build_desc );    
    assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);

  When the build completes successfully the acceleration structure
  buffer can get used as acceleration structure by the ray tracing
  API.


  Parallel Build
  --------------

  In order to speed up the build operation with multiple worker
  thread, some parallel operation object can get attached to the build
  and joined with application provided worker threads as in the
  following example:

     ze_raytracing_parallel_operation_ext_handle_t hParallelOperation;
     ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingParallelOperationCreateExt(&hParallelOperation);
     assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);

     build_desc.parallelOperation = hParallelOperation;

     result = zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt( &build_desc );    
     assert(result == ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_OPERATION_DEFERRED);

     uint32_t pMaxConcurrency = 0;
     result = zeRaytracingParallelOperationGetMaxConcurrencyExt( hParallelOperation, &MaxConcurrency );
     assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);

     tbb::parallel_for(0u,pMaxConcurrency,1u,[&](uint32_t i) {
       ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingParallelOperationJoinExt(hParallelOperation);
       assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);
     });
     
     result = zeRaytracingParallelOperationDestroyExt(hParallelOperation);
     assert(result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS);


   Conservative Acceleration Buffer Size
   -------------------------------------

   While using the conservative size estimate of the acceleration
   structure guarantees a successfull build, the memory requirements
   are larger than typically required. To reduce memory usage the
   application can also use the expected acceleration buffer size and
   re-try the build operation in case it ran out of memory. The
   following code illustrates this concept:

     void* accelBuffer = nullptr;
     size_t accel_bytes = accel_size.accelBufferExpectedBytes;
    
     while (true)
     {
       accelBuffer = allocate_accel_buffer(accel_bytes);
  
       build_desc.accelBuffer = accelBuffer;
       build_desc.accelBufferBytes = accel_bytes;
       build_desc.accelBufferBytesOut = &accel_bytes;
  
       ze_result_t result = zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt( &build_desc );    
       if (result == ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS) break;

       assert(result == ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_RETRY_BUILD_ACCEL);
       // accel_bytes got increased to a larger estimate for a next try

       free_accel_buffer(accelBuffer);
     }

  The loop starts with the expected acceleration buffer size, for
  which the build will mostly succeed. If the build runs out of memory
  the ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_RETRY_BUILD_ACCEL result is returned
  and the build can get re-tried with a larger acceleration structure
  buffer.

  The example above passes a pointer to the accel_bytes variable as
  accelBufferBytesOut input to the build operation. This causes the
  builder to write a larger acceleration structure size estimate to be
  used in the next try into the accel_bytes variable. Alternatively,
  the application can also increase the acceleration buffer size for
  the next try by some percentage, or just use the worst case size for
  a second try.

  \brief Geometry descriptor of a quad mesh

  This geometry descriptor describes a quad mesh consisting of a quad
  buffer (index buffer), and vertex buffer. The indices index
  respective vertices in the vertex array.

  A quad is a triangle pair represented using 4 vertex indices
  v0,v1,v2,v3. The first triangle is made out of indices v0,v1,v3 and
  the second triangle from indices v2,v3,v1. The piecewise linear
  barycentric u/v pametrization of the quad is defined to be (u=0,
  v=0) at v0, (u=1, v=0) at v1, (u=0, v=1) at v3, and (u=1, v=1) at
  v2. This is achieved by correcting the u'/v' coordinates of the
  second triangle by u = 1-u' and v = 1-v', yielding a piecewise
  linear parametrization.

/**
   
   \brief Builds a ray tracing acceleration structure

   The zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt function builds an acceleration
   structure of the scene consisting of the specified geometry
   descriptors and writes the acceleration structure to the provided
   destination buffer. All types of geometries can get freely mixed
   inside a scene. Please see ze_raytracing_build_accel_ext_desc_t for
   a description of all input arguments.

   It is the users responsibility to manage the acceleration structure
   buffer allocation, deallocation, and potential prefetching to the
   device memory. The required size of the accleration structure
   buffer can be queried with the zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt
   function. The acceleration structure buffer must be a shared USM
   allocation and should be present on the host at build time. The
   referenced scene data (index and vertex buffers) can be standard
   host allocations, and will not be referenced into by the build
   acceleration structure.
   
   Before an accleration structure is build, the user has to use the
   zeRaytracingGetAccelSize function to query the size of the
   acceleration structure and scratch space buffer to allocate. When
   using the worst case size to allocate the acceleration structure
   buffer, then the zeRaytracingBuildAccelExt function will never fail
   with an out of memory error. When using the expected size for the
   acceleration structure buffer, then the build may fail with
   ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_RETRY_BUILD_ACCEL and should then get
   re-tried with a larger amount of data. Using the
   accelBufferBytesOut argument, the build itself returns an improved
   size estimate which the user can use to re-try the build.
   
   The acceleration structure build is executed on the host CPU and is
   synchronous, thus after the function returns with ZE_RESULT_SUCCESS
   the acceleration structure can get used. All provided data buffers
   have to be accessible from the host, thus no device memory can get
   passed. Unified shared memory has to get used for the acceleration
   structure buffer, for the builder to be able to write to it and the
   device to read from that buffer. 

   The constructed accleration structure is self contained, thus does
   not require the provided build data to be present after the build
   is done.

   The constructed acceleration structure cannot get copied into a
   different memory buffer as it may contain pointers.

   The acceleration build operation can get parallelized by passing a
   parallel operation and joining that parallel operation using the
   zeRaytracingParallelOperationJoinExt call with user provided worker
   threads. When a parallel operation is provided the
   zeRaytracingGetAccelSizeExt function returns with result
   ZE_RESULT_RAYTRACING_EXT_OPERATION_DEFERRED to indicate that the
   build operation is still in progress. The return value of the
   zeRaytracingParallelOperationJoinExt function determines the status
   of the parallel acceleration structure build.
